</table><br><br><br><br>	There doesnt seem to be an end in sigt. Today is April 30th, my 60th day give or take in quarantine. I have left the trailer park one time since Feb 28, that was last Thursday night. I left because my mother had begun to threaten my mental health. She called a mental health crisis line and had two policemen detain (and in my opinion illigally arrest) me all over a suspicion of my mental health. I take these threats as the most serious threat to my life and liberty that I may have ever endured. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	My fear involves a serious dis-trust of psychologists, and the powerful mind altering drugs they use to treat their patients. I worry that if I am forced to ingest a brain-poison I may never be the same man again, that I will in all intents and purposes cease to exist. I will die if you will. My mother has been lured into a cult and after many years of mass media brain washing does not truly appreciate the truth of existence. She who believes in prayer, and whole heartdedly sells Mary-Kay scam product would dare accuse me of having a mental health issue. Nay not only accuse, but make a desperate, and dishonest, call to the police thinking that they will somehow enforce her deranged and demented opinion of me. Thankfully the police turned out to be decent people in this case.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	I walked for 15 miles or so. North for maybe 3, I reached a church "This too shall pass" and took a piss before I realized: It's 30 miles south to the train station and only 11 miles north. I turned around. By the time I was back where I started my feet hurt. I had not walked even a full mile since February and was (am!) horribly out of shape. I considered returning home, until I read the text messages she had sent me. She addmited to calling 911, the emergency line, and that if I returned she would expect me to seek 'mental health treatment' There could be no returning. I pushed on, northward.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	I walked for another 2 hourse before my feet could take it no more. Each step sent shocks of pain through my feet and it felt quite like they might fall off at any moment. I tried loosening my shoolaces to no avail, perhaps to little too late, I took many freaquent breaks but the damage was done. At 4:20 in the morning I had made it 5 miles north of my mother's house and still had 6 miles to walk to make it to the train station. I knew then that my injured body would need to be a priority. I turned around again and walked south, back to my mother. I had little choice and had to make decisions that would do the least amount of damage.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	On my walk back the pain greatly increased. By the final mile before the trailer park I could hardly stand and every bench, rock, and bridge handrail recieved a ten minute+ rest. My feet were in extreme pain. My body, which had thus far been taken for granted, had failed me. That final mile took nearly an hour. I walked in shambles, daring only to tread on the grasy overgrowth off the shoulder of the road. Concrete made it hurt worse. At last I arrived where I came in quietly, stripped naked, and barricaded the door to my room. Mother tried to make contact and I grufly dispelled her with the last of my energy translated into implied threats both legal and physical. I took a bath in hand sanitizer. The contact with the police had been the most severe and egregious breach in COVID protocoll I had made since riding the 38 in January. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	I awoke to the sounds of Robert returning from his flour, and other creature comforts, mission. The root of this whole issue had been with him. The fat and useless fool had decided that a quarantine was simply unbearable without a loaf of bread and some fake soy-meat. He is a walking ghost, a shadow of what man ought to be, a deluded and self-imposed slave with a great disdain for yours truly. He is my mortal enemy. Since that day, Friday, 6 days ago, I have lurked in the shadows behing these creatures. I have pissed in bottles, I have eaten out of cans, and I have plotted my escape.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	My debit card has expired, and the train station will not accept cash any more. I think that I can buy a Visa gift card in a Safeway and use that to pay for a train ticket but then the lack of a debit card will continue to be a pain in the ass. Not to mention I have no where to go even if I could reach California. I would need a tent and a sleeping bag, or a car would be lovely as well. I have only a few hundred cash and no way to access the goodly thousands locked within my digital bank account. So here I have stalled out and slowly nursed my feet back to their health. The pain has subsided but I fear the damage has not been repaired. The train station is still 11 miles north. I have no bicycle, no skateboard, hell no way to pay for an Uber even.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	In closing I feel defeated, betrayed, and almost without hope. The quarantine will persist for many weeks, or even months, and after all this COVID will surely return this holiday season, perhaps with a vengence. I have no job to return to, no friends or family to stay with, and no skill to fall back on. Food supplies may run aground between now and the new year and ultimately a war with China does not seem entirely impossible. It is the end of the world as we know it, and i'm in pain...
