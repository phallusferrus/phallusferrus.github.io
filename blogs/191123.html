</table><br><br><br><br>Okay I have settled on A topic and can now devote myself entirely in pursuit of a goal. Right? Well reality is never quite as simple as fantasy, and the actualization of any particular act is never as effortless as dreaming of it's sweet taste, victoriously exheaving it's never known ripeness in a futile exhalation "WOOOSH to win and be loved" but it may be and more likely it will be not. Regardless the details provided can be made, argued rather to seem rather possible and expedient. By persuasion portray the peninsula of Saint Francis to be natural birthright of all on earth, or at least in America. Our mild (if not preferable) weather, tolerant law enforcement, and robust economy speak for themselves.

	Why, if any more than a product of my birth, must I suffer to slave in the basement kept from the fat couch of modern pale academia. There are no doubt peers of my own age knowing nothing of the journey of Aeneas, the reagents for Lycergic acid, the meaning of Lear's madness, the reason for Satan's continued pursuit of evil not to mention the subtle sound of terrapin station 2/26/77 - 2/27/77  - 3/18/77 You know what I mean. How has it been allowed to pass that I should sit in this room poor and alone while people of far less quality rule above taking uber to the airport they spend too much money on stupid ass shit like cabins and new clothes and fuck relatively speaking I am one of them. I have too much. I spend too much. How on earth am I supposed to continue to live like this? I dunnow if i can make it. What a time I've had writing to the allman dark star spanish jam 70 yeah this is prolly the best spanish jam fersure.
