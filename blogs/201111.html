Too much stuff to talk about, and I have fallen too far behind to catch up. This is a dream journal post.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I was in Etiennes house and Noelle came by. We just hung out and then we went for a walk around Arcata. I remember Sunny Brae Murphy's and a Pho place by Safeway I guess. This was connected with the dream alternate reality that exists between Eureka and Arcata. I've been there before but only in dreams. That place with the pancakes or breakfast food or something. It must be a tripped out version of Tony's...it's in the Oriental Buffet Parking lot but spatially it's south of Arcata.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
None of that is REAL BTW it was only a product of my sleeping mind. The dream left me feeling so warm, and wholesome though. I didn't even jerk off! (lol)
<br><br><br>

5 years ago to the day I went with Noelle, and Destiny, to Fern Canyon. They were closed for the holiday but I drove my truck around the gate they had set up and it saved me the $15 dollar registration fee or whatever too. The road was flooded but we left the truck and made our way out there. It was surreal, no one around and one of the best days of my life. I believe I took her to Top of the World after we got back to Arcata. Strange then taht this dream should have hit me 5 years later...and on the same day of the week.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Expect something to happen on Friday the 13th, if anyone reads this before then probably get some food and water packed up and turn off your TV would be my advice. If I turn out to be wrong, God help us all.
<br><br><br>

I myself have faith. Last tuesday, the 3rd, was the most beautiful sunrise swiftly followed by the most ominous storm clouds. The rain still hasn't let up but I'm sure that sunrise will come back out.
