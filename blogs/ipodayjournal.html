	Today was the IPO of Pinterest. I work in the kitchen and arrived 
<br><br><br>
very early to prepare the breakfast. I always come in early and as soon 
<br><br><br>
as I noticed the balloons on the tables I knew something had to be up. I 
<br><br><br>
already knew what NYSE was and a quick trip to r/wallstreetbets confirmed
<br><br><br>
that the IPO was today. I had breakfast: three slices of peanut butter
<br><br><br>
toast and two shots of espresso (I may have also had some jam and a 
<br><br><br>
Larabar (or two!)) and was dressed and ready by 3:58. I clocked in at 
<br><br><br>
6 on the dot and did the following:
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
			4:00		Quiche
<br><br><br>
			4:30		Hat, $25 and phone meeting!
<br><br><br>
			4:45		Broccolini...
<br><br><br>
			5:15		Dishes (forgot to temp!)
<br><br><br>
			6:00		Begin singing Sgt. Peppers...
<br><br><br>
			6:40		Finish singing Sgt. Peppers
<br><br><br>
			7:30		Shanlong enters
<br><br><br>
			8		Muffins>
<br><br><br>
			8:30 ish?	Go upstairs and take a walk
<br><br><br>
			8:50		Come back
<br><br><br>
			9		Bread
<br><br><br>
			10 		IPO bonus meeting (Thanks Chris!)
<br><br><br>
			10:15		Back to Bread
<br><br><br>
			11		Lunch (Mongolian beef + shrimp)
<br><br><br>
			11:30		
<br><br><br>
			12		Laugh with Oscar over Chicken
<br><br><br>
			12:45		Help Adrianna with walk in!
<br><br><br>
			1		Muffins
<br><br><br>
			1:30		Dishes basically I think
<br><br><br>
			2:05		Shit
<br><br><br>
			2:15		Break
<br><br><br>
			2:30		Later Skater
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 It was a great day in every way, until I got off...
<br><br><br>
	All that happened was that Dick called and I didn't answer(Or call
<br><br><br>
him back!) and that Chris wanted to chill and he wanted to talk business.
<br><br><br>
To be clear that is the only thing Chris is interested in, business. Not
<br><br><br>
that business is all bad or even half bad (to be quite sure entrepreneurship
<br><br><br>
is a respectable quality but it is as boring and tedious in action as it is
<br><br><br>
in spelling!) but that it is simply not exciting to me. I can never imagine
<br><br><br>
myself daydreaming at work about building a t-shirt empire, but then again
<br><br><br>
I suppose one aspect of entrepreneurship is to break oneself free from the
<br><br><br>
monotony of an 8 hour work day. Plus the work I do now is unsteady.
<br><br><br>
	For at least as long as I rely on the bus for transportation, I cannot
<br><br><br>
say that I will 100% reliably be able to come to work on time. Only through
<br><br><br>
transportational independence can I say without a doubt "Yes I can be there
<br><br><br>
at this time, no problem" every other time I say it, it is only a lie. Or
<br><br><br>
really just an exaggeration, I mean after nearly 2 months I haven't been late
<br><br><br>
a single time, yet I know that if I were to miss the bus twice (Which already
<br><br><br>
it drove past me once...twice) AND fail to catch an Uber, I'd be tardy. Would
<br><br><br>
I be fired for it? Absolutely not! But any failure is simply unacceptable to 
<br><br><br>
me.
<br><br><br>
	I depend on other people for my money. No doubt about it, I cannot 
<br><br><br>
survive without
<br><br><br>
		  I. A boss to sign my check (Gwen) 
<br><br><br>
		 II. A supervisor to give me a task (Ernesto)
<br><br><br>
		III. Co-workers who will not rat me out!
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	I am surely at their mercy and I must keep them all happy or else I may
<br><br><br>
find myself on the outside again. Not that I am afraid of the outside, I have
<br><br><br>
spent 5 months of my life so far as a homeless person and I am not very worried
<br><br><br>
about it again. I do remember how much I can feel despair though and I admit
<br><br><br>
that if I had my way, Id stay the fuck indoors! So all things being equal I
<br><br><br>
simply must pay rent ~somewhere~ not necessarily here at 876 36th AVE in SF
<br><br><br>
or otherwise find suitable arrangements for my survival.
<br><br><br>
	I am not healthy at the moment. Yesterday I went into the park and
<br><br><br>
did 50 or so pushups in Lindley Meadows while listening to The White Album.
<br><br><br>
Today I smoked an 1/8th or so of my weed with Chris, then I gave him more. He
<br><br><br>
is unhealthy. Donuts, smoking, dirty socks, I am worried about the time I
<br><br><br>
spend with him. Surely I could be spending it in a better way. A more
<br><br><br>
productive way. But what is production? The creation of goods. What goods can
<br><br><br>
I produce? Today I produced a lot of laughs and this .txt file. Chris would
<br><br><br>
define success as production of money. I would define happiness as production
<br><br><br>
of the good neurotransmitter up in the brain.
<br><br><br>
	Hungry, sore, and bored: I must sleep and prepare for the morning...
<br><br><br>
4 am will be here soon.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
PS Use a text editor next time :)
