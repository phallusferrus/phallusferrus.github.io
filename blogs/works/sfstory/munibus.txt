as I woke up and glanced at the time
10 minutes till, I had to get moving.
First thing was to put on my clothes, ice cold
slipping into the same pair of black jeans

INTRO / ARGUMENT
POETIC STORY ANECDOTE ABOUT COPS



Now listen cuz I'll only say this once
I want nothing more than to leave this place
and live a better life far far away
but understand that why I'm even here
is just becaue I want to clean this mess.
Eleven months you had me locked in here
Eleven months I couldn't use the trash
or wash my clothes or even brush my teeth.
I stayed away from you as best I could
because I didn't want to bother you
but mom, eleven months not even once
you couldn't have stayed out on Sunday night
and let met throw away a bag of trash?
Or even closed your door so I could walk
outside without waking you up at night?
I've had to b


And who was it that put me in this jail?

Eleven months because I hate to fight


but understand that I am kept by shame.
Eleven months I stayed locked up in here
because I was ashamed to see your face
To leave it in

You want the room clean and I want the room clean
We should work together to achieve this goal

>sees me as a threat and nuisance

>thinks i'm terrified of covid

>wants me out of the room

I:
>Want to be left alone

>wan't a better place to live / a better life

>do NOT want any ~attention~


The only reasonable thing to do would be to fake an apology and pretend that i was only afread of the virus and didn't know what to do try to appeal to her own fear and limited world view
