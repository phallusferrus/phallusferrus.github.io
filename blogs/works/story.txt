In the long ago Titans terrorized the earth. Earth,Air,Water,Fire+RayQuaza. Mew sealed them away and left shrines as guardians over the imprisoned. Over time people forgot the work of the guardians but they carry on. Mew's return awoke the Titans who had slumbered long however their prisons remain shut

The PARTY outlaws religion, alleges Mythic Pokemon aren't real. They win the war but Mew appears as a sign. The party capture mew with a master ball and distort it into MEWTWO. They use MEWTWO to destroy the 6 shrines and take over the 7th.

? Pokemon DIE in battle in canon!
	I like this idea actually, give the RIVAL a new team each time you fight him, maybe he picks the best from the last few routes you've went through. Have him start with a Ratatta and after the first battle you kill it but he brings it back as a gengar (at the graveyard!)

>Story

Opening is a TV thing with the announcer showing that Mew has returned.
Apocolypse! Big War has killed most people and now Mew has returned! People are begging repentance while others are embracing sin. 
older Brother is ASSHOLE
Grandma says he is to take you to the next town over to see Mew and she's too old to go
Says you will be allowed to choose PokeMon then gets into bed and dies (sleeps)
You little brother challenges you to a pokemon battle.
You find some PokeBalls on the road.
You (and your brother) walk to the next town over (or next BIG town over maybe)
You meet Sage of Mew in the next town over. Asks you about your parents why you're alone, seems sad. She's hot and says something about how you're special for some reason.
When you arrive there is a great crowd of people around the church. You find your brother who mocks you and says to go play in the trainer school since they can't get in anyway. After defeating the Evee lady (you shouldn't play with the other kids you're too strong) there's a big explosion
and you go out to find BigEvil along with Goons holdng a Rally scene thing. BigEvil Captured Mew and is declaring some empire of PokeMon. People are generally afraid, then your Brother gets up and joins them! BigEvil laughs and talks esotaric about becoming God or whatever and your brother tells you to join the party or you're dead to him. Babe tells you that the Party will try to take the power from all seven shrines and that someone must stop them. She say's they're headed to Under the Mountain and that you must go there to stop them.


It's your OLDER brother, he already has a PokeMon, he's not the first battle

The party has just won! After a long and gruelling war The Party announces that there is to be a great celebration in the capital.

Mew has appeared (after a cataclismac war) you and your brother are sent to go see it by your grandmother who is too old to go with you. She tells you to take care of your little bro. And sends you off with a PokeMon to protect you.


Mew appears in a smaller city near you, grandma sends you to go see it cuz muh religion and she dies leaves you with the dog Eevee. You arrive at the normal town, Big Crowd, bro saves your place, Gym 1, you come out, meet your bro at front of the line, go in, chapel warship mew shit, evil party breaks in steals mew, talk about some new world order shit. THEY have all the Master Balls. HQ == SF. Bro tells you he's going to join thm. Babe tells you that you need to stop them.

Mew gets taken by ASSHOLE whom you defeat BUT by knocking out mew you 
In mew's absence shit starts getting fucked


Mew has appeared at the church in the next town over. You are to escort your brother over with pokemon you borrow from PROF but he steals the mew and tries to battle you. In the process you KO mew and cause BigEvil to appear who take your brother who tries to defend mew. You discover the only way to save your bro is to gain the power of the sages and travel to the spirit realm where BigEvil lives.
