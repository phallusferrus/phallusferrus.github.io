Hello Luke,

I hope all is well. I am writing to you at the dawn of a new age. As I am sure you are well aware tech companies from Twitter to Firefox have worked together with msm and senators to bring about a bad time. I am hoping you will not only speak out, but also offer help for normies on how to connect toand benefit from more decentralized usage of the internet.
