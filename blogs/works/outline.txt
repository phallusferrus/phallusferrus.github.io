>SHOULD allow player to go to SF early and just fight OP trainers. Maybe they can't get into the tower.

Rival is your neighbor who gets a personal vendetta against you after you kill his togepi. Starts nerdy gay ends angry mean. First encounter he brags about his togepi being the best but you kill it so he freaks out. Next he comes against you rashly with weak bug types. Next he ambushes you with stronger mons like growlithe in the tunell. He makes his way to Slab City via the coast (You can encounter him (garydos) in the rock slide if you go that way early ! You next encounter him in Slab City (tyrantar) where he's become street smart and acquired a bike. You beat him and take the bike. At this point he runs off to join some cult (PARTY? Graveyard cult?) He arrives after your Party Boss Fight 1 and is one of the three people MEWTWO grants a wish to.
