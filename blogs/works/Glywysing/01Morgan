I am King Morgan II Over 250 years ago Morgan the Great created the Kingdom of Glywysing, unifying all the lands between Gwent and the River Towy. Over the years our kingdom has declined and we now rule only Gwent and the area of Glywysing near the sea. Even the Bishopric of Merthyr Tydfil has fallen under the protection of my Cousin Deheubarth. My father ruled until the old age of 80 and I ascended to the throne at an old age myself. Now 62 I wish to see my people grow wise and rich and I will help my son to learn to rule justly and fairly. I have contacted the King of Germany, Otto, to see if his wife would marry my son. I wish to make a statement to the other Welsh kings that the Kingdom of Morgan stands above the rest.

Many people around me have noticed my constant cynicsm and I can see them growing more cynical as well. Good, I'm glad they're finally seeing the truth.

Since my wife hit 40 I haven't been enjoying her as much as I used to. Despite what the churches preach I've been having some crazy orgies at the palace and they're bunches of fun.
