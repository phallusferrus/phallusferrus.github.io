RUTH
1:1: Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land.  And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
1:2: And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah.  And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
1:3: And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
1:4: And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other  and they dwelled there about ten years.
1:5: And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
1:6: Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
1:7: Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
1:8: And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
1:9: The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.  Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
1:10: And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people. 
1:11: And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?  are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
1:12: Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband.  If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
1:13: Would ye tarry for them till they were grown?  would ye stay for them from having husbands?  nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.
1:14: And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
1:15: And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.
1:16: And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: 
1:17: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.
1:18: When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. 
1:19: So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.  And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? 
1:20: And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
1:21: I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
1:22: So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
2:1: And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.
2:2: And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace.  And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
2:3: And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
2:4: And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you.  And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.
2:5: Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
2:6: And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
2:7: And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
2:8: Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter?  Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:
2:9: Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee?  and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
2:10: Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?
2:11: And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
2:12: The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.
2:13: Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.
2:14: And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.  And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
2:15: And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
2:16: And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not. 
2:17: So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
2:18: And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed. 
2:19: And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day?  and where wroughtest thou?  blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.  And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz. 
2:20: And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.  And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.
2:21: And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
2:22: And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
2:23: So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.
3:1: Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
3:2: And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?  Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.
3:3: Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
3:4: And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
3:5: And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.
3:6: And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.
3:7: And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
3:8: And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
3:9: And he said, Who art thou?  And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.
3:10: And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.
3:11: And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.
3:12: And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
3:13: Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.
3:14: And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another.  And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.
3:15: Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it.  And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city. 
3:16: And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter?  And she told her all that the man had done to her.
3:17: And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law. 
3:18: Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day. 
4:1: Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one!  turn aside, sit down here.  And he turned aside, and sat down.
4:2: And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here.  And they sat down.
4:3: And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:
4:4: And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people.  If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee.  And he said, I will redeem it.
4:5: Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
4:6: And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.
4:7: Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.
4:8: Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee.  So he drew off his shoe.
4:9: And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
4:10: Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
4:11: And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses.  The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
4:12: And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.
4:13: So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.
4:14: And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
4:15: And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.
4:16: And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
4:17: And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
4:18: Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
4:19: And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 
4:20: And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
4:21: And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
4:22: And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

FIRST SAMUEL
1:1: Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
1:2: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 
1:3: And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh.  And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.
1:4: And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 
1:5: But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb. 
1:6: And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.
1:7: And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
1:8: Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?  and why eatest thou not?  and why is thy heart grieved?  am not I better to thee than ten sons?
1:9: So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk.  Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.
1:10: And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.
1:11: And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
1:12: And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.
1:13: Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
1:14: And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken?  put away thy wine from thee.
1:15: And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
1:16: Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
1:17: Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
1:18: And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight.  So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.
1:19: And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
1:20: Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.
1:21: And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
1:22: But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.
1:23: And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word.  So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
1:24: And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.
1:25: And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. 
1:26: And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.
1:27: For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: 
1:28: Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD.  And he worshipped the LORD there. 
2:1: And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
2:2: There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.
2:3: Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
2:4: The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
2:5: They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
2:6: The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
2:7: The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
2:8: He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.
2:9: He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
2:10: The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
2:11: And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.  And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
2:12: Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
2:13: And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
2:14: And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself.  So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
2:15: Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
2:16: And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
2:17: Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
2:18: But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
2:19: Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
2:20: And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD.  And they went unto their own home.
2:21: And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters.  And the child Samuel grew before the LORD. 
2:22: Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
2:23: And he said unto them, Why do ye such things?  for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
2:24: Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.
2:25: If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?  Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
2:26: And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.
2:27: And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
2:28: And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me?  and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
2:29: Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
2:30: Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
2:31: Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
2:32: And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.
2:33: And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.
2:34: And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
2:35: And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
2:36: And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.
3:1: And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli.  And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
3:2: And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
3:3: And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;
3:4: That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.
3:5: And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.  And he said, I called not; lie down again.  And he went and lay down. 
3:6: And the LORD called yet again, Samuel.  And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.  And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
3:7: Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. 
3:8: And the LORD called Samuel again the third time.  And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.  And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child. 
3:9: Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth.  So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
3:10: And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.  Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
3:11: And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
3:12: In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
3:13: For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
3:14: And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. 
3:15: And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD.  And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
3:16: Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son.  And he answered, Here am I. 
3:17: And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?  I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. 
3:18: And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him.  And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.
3:19: And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
3:20: And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.
3:21: And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
4:1: And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.  Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
4:2: And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
4:3: And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines?  Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
4:4: So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
4:5: And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
4:6: And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?  And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.
4:7: And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp.  And they said, Woe unto us!  for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
4:8: Woe unto us!  who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods?  these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
4:9: Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
4:10: And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
4:11: And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
4:12: And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
4:13: And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God.  And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
4:14: And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult?  And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
4:15: Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see. 
4:16: And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army.  And he said, What is there done, my son?
4:17: And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. 
4:18: And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy.  And he had judged Israel forty years. 
4:19: And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
4:20: And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son.  But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
4:21: And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.
4:22: And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.
5:1: And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.
5:2: When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
5:3: And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD.  And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
5:4: And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
5:5: Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.
5:6: But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.
5:7: And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
5:8: They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?  And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath.  And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.
5:9: And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.
5:10: Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron.  And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
5:11: So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
5:12: And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
6:1: And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
6:2: And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD?  tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place. 
6:3: And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
6:4: Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?  They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. 
6:5: Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. 
6:6: Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts?  when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
6:7: Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:
6:8: And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.
6:9: And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.
6:10: And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
6:11: And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
6:12: And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.
6:13: And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
6:14: And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.
6:15: And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.
6:16: And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
6:17: And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
6:18: And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite.
6:19: And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.
6:20: And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God?  and to whom shall he go up from us?
6:21: And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.
7:1: And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.
7:2: And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
7:3: And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. 
7:4: Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.
7:5: And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD. 
7:6: And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD.  And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh. 
7:7: And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel.  And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
7:8: And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
7:9: And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.
7:10: And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.
7:11: And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car.
7:12: Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.
7:13: So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
7:14: And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines.  And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
7:15: And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
7:16: And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.
7:17: And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.
8:1: And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
8:2: Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.
8:3: And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
8:4: Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
8:5: And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
8:6: But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us.  And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.
8:7: And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
8:8: According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. 
8:9: Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
8:10: And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. 
8:11: And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. 
8:12: And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
8:13: And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
8:14: And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
8:15: And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
8:16: And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
8:17: He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
8:18: And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
8:19: Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;
8:20: That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
8:21: And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.
8:22: And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king.  And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
9:1: Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
9:2: And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
9:3: And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost.  And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
9:4: And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.
9:5: And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.
9:6: And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.
9:7: Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man?  for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
9:8: And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. 
9:9: (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
9:10: Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go.  So they went unto the city where the man of God was. 
9:11: And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? 
9:12: And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:
9:13: As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden.  Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.
9:14: And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.
9:15: Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
9:16: To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
9:17: And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of!  this same shall reign over my people.
9:18: Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.
9:19: And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.
9:20: And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found.  And on whom is all the desire of Israel?  Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
9:21: And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel?  and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?  wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
9:22: And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.
9:23: And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
9:24: And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul.  And Samuel said, Behold that which is left!  set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people.  So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
9:25: And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
9:26: And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away.  And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
9:27: And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
10:1: Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?
10:2: When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
10:3: Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
10:4: And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
10:5: After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
10:6: And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. 
10:7: And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.
10:8: And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do. 
10:9: And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day. 
10:10: And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
10:11: And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish?  Is Saul also among the prophets?
10:12: And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father?  Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
10:13: And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
10:14: And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye?  And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.
10:15: And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
10:16: And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found.  But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
10:17: And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
10:18: And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:
10:19: And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us.  Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
10:20: And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
10:21: When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
10:22: Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither.  And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
10:23: And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
10:24: And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?  And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
10:25: Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD.  And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
10:26: And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
10:27: But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?  And they despised him, and brought him no presents.  But he held his peace.
11:1: Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee. 
11:2: And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
11:3: And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee. 
11:4: Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept. 
11:5: And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep?  And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
11:6: And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
11:7: And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.  And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
11:8: And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
11:9: And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help.  And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
11:10: Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
11:11: And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
11:12: And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us?  bring the men, that we may put them to death.
11:13: And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.
11:14: Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
11:15: And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
12:1: And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
12:2: And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.
12:3: Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken?  or whose ass have I taken?  or whom have I defrauded?  whom have I oppressed?  or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?  and I will restore it you.
12:4: And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.
12:5: And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.  And they answered, He is witness.
12:6: And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
12:7: Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.
12:8: When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. 
12:9: And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
12:10: And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee. 
12:11: And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe. 
12:12: And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.
12:13: Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired!  and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
12:14: If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:
12:15: But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.
12:16: Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.
12:17: Is it not wheat harvest to day?  I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.
12:18: So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
12:19: And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.
12:20: And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;
12:21: And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
12:22: For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.
12:23: Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
12:24: Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.
12:25: But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
13:1: Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
13:2: Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
13:3: And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it.  And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
13:4: And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines.  And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
13:5: And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.
13:6: When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
13:7: And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.  As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. 
13:8: And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
13:9: And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings.  And he offered the burnt offering. 
13:10: And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. 
13:11: And Samuel said, What hast thou done?  And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
13:12: Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
13:13: And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
13:14: But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.
13:15: And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.  And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
13:16: And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
13:17: And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
13:18: And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
13:19: Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
13:20: But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
13:21: Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
13:22: So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
13:23: And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
14:1: Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side.  But he told not his father.
14:2: And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
14:3: And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.  And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
14:4: And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
14:5: The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
14:6: And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. 
14:7: And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
14:8: Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. 
14:9: If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. 
14:10: But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.
14:11: And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
14:12: And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing.  And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
14:13: And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.
14:14: And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
14:15: And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
14:16: And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
14:17: Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us.  And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.
14:18: And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God.  For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
14:19: And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
14:20: And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
14:21: Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
14:22: Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
14:23: So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven.
14:24: And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies.  So none of the people tasted any food.
14:25: And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
14:26: And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
14:27: But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
14:28: Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day.  And the people were faint.
14:29: Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
14:30: How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found?  for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
14:31: And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint. 
14:32: And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood. 
14:33: Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood.  And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.
14:34: And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.  And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
14:35: And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.
14:36: And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.  And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee.  Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
14:37: And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?  wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?  But he answered him not that day.
14:38: And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
14:39: For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.  But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
14:40: Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.  And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
14:41: Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot.  And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
14:42: And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.  And Jonathan was taken.
14:43: Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done.  And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.
14:44: And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
14:45: And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel?  God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day.  So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
14:46: Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
14:47: So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.
14:48: And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
14:49: Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
14:50: And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
14:51: And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
14:52: And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him. 
15:1: Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD. 
15:2: Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. 
15:3: Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
15:4: And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
15:5: And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
15:6: And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.  So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
15:7: And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
15:8: And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
15:9: But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
15:10: Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,
15:11: It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments.  And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.
15:12: And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
15:13: And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
15:14: And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
15:15: And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
15:16: Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night.  And he said unto him, Say on.
15:17: And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?
15:18: And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
15:19: Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?
15:20: And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
15:21: But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.
15:22: And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD?  Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. 
15:23: For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.  Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.
15:24: And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. 
15:25: Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD. 
15:26: And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
15:27: And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
15:28: And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.
15:29: And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
15:30: Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.
15:31: So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
15:32: Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.  And Agag came unto him delicately.  And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
15:33: And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women.  And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
15:34: Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
15:35: And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
16:1: And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?  fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
16:2: And Samuel said, How can I go?  if Saul hear it, he Will kill me.  And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.
16:3: And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
16:4: And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.  And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
16:5: And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.  And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
16:6: And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.
16:7: But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
16:8: Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.  And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
16:9: Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by.  And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. 
16:10: Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.  And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.
16:11: And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children?  And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.  And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. 
16:12: And he sent, and brought him in.  Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to.  And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he. 
16:13: Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward.  So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
16:14: But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
16:15: And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
16:16: Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
16:17: And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
16:18: Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.
16:19: Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.
16:20: And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
16:21: And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.
16:22: And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.
16:23: And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
17:1: Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
17:2: And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
17:3: And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
17:4: And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
17:5: And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
17:6: And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
17:7: And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
17:8: And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array?  am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul?  choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. 
17:9: If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
17:10: And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. 
17:11: When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. 
17:12: Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.
17:13: And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
17:14: And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
17:15: But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
17:16: And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. 
17:17: And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;
17:18: And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge. 
17:19: Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 
17:20: And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
17:21: For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
17:22: And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
17:23: And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.
17:24: And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
17:25: And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up?  surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
17:26: And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel?  for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
17:27: And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
17:28: And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither?  and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness?  I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
17:29: And David said, What have I now done?  Is there not a cause?
17:30: And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
17:31: And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.
17:32: And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
17:33: And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
17:34: And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:
17:35: And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
17:36: Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
17:37: David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.  And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.
17:38: And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
17:39: And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it.  And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them.  And David put them off him. 
17:40: And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.
17:41: And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him. 
17:42: And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. 
17:43: And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?  And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
17:44: And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
17:45: Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
17:46: This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
17:47: And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.
17:48: And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
17:49: And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
17:50: So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
17:51: Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith.  And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
17:52: And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron.  And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
17:53: And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.
17:54: And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
17:55: And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?  And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
17:56: And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.
17:57: And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
17:58: And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man?  And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
18:1: And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
18:2: And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
18:3: Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 
18:4: And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
18:5: And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants. 
18:6: And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. 
18:7: And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
18:8: And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
18:9: And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
18:10: And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
18:11: And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it.  And David avoided out of his presence twice.
18:12: And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.
18:13: Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
18:14: And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.
18:15: Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
18:16: But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
18:17: And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles.  For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
18:18: And David said unto Saul, Who am I?  and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?
18:19: But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
18:20: And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
18:21: And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.  Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.
18:22: And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.
18:23: And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David.  And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
18:24: And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.
18:25: And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies.  But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
18:26: And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired. 
18:27: Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law.  And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
18:28: And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him. 
18:29: And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
18:30: Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
19:1: And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
19:2: But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself: 
19:3: And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
19:4: And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to theeward very good: 
19:5: For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause? 
19:6: And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.
19:7: And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things.  And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
19:8: And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
19:9: And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.
19:10: And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
19:11: Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.
19:12: So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
19:13: And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.
19:14: And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
19:15: And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
19:16: And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.
19:17: And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped?  And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
19:18: So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him.  And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
19:19: And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
19:20: And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
19:21: And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise.  And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
19:22: Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David?  And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.
19:23: And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
19:24: And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.  Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
20:1: And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done?  what is mine iniquity?  and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
20:2: And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me?  it is not so. 
20:3: And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death. 
20:4: Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.
20:5: And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.
20:6: If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
20:7: If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.
20:8: Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
20:9: And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
20:10: Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me?  or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
20:11: And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field.  And they went out both of them into the field.
20:12: And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;
20:13: The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
20:14: And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:
20:15: But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
20:16: So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.
20:17: And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
20:18: Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
20:19: And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
20:20: And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
20:21: And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.  If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.
20:22: But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.
20:23: And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever. 
20:24: So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.
20:25: And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty. 
20:26: Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean. 
20:27: And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
20:28: And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:
20:29: And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren.  Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.
20:30: Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
20:31: For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom.  Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
20:32: And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain?  what hath he done?
20:33: And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
20:34: So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
20:35: And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
20:36: And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot.  And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
20:37: And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
20:38: And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not.  And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
20:39: But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
20:40: And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
20:41: And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
20:42: And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.  And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.
21:1: Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
21:2: And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.
21:3: Now therefore what is under thine hand?  give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present. 
21:4: And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
21:5: And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
21:6: So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
21:7: Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.
21:8: And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword?  for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
21:9: And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here.  And David said, There is none like that; give it me. 
21:10: And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
21:11: And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land?  did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? 
21:12: And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 
21:13: And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
21:14: Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?
21:15: Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence?  shall this fellow come into my house?
22:1: David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.
22:2: And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
22:3: And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.
22:4: And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.
22:5: And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah.  Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
22:6: When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)
22:7: Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
22:8: That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
22:9: Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
22:10: And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
22:11: Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
22:12: And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub.  And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
22:13: And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
22:14: Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
22:15: Did I then begin to enquire of God for him?  be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
22:16: And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house. 
22:17: And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me.  But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.
22:18: And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.  And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. 
22:19: And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword. 
22:20: And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
22:21: And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.
22:22: And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.
22:23: Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
23:1: Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.
23:2: Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines?  And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
23:3: And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
23:4: Then David enquired of the LORD yet again.  And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
23:5: So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter.  So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
23:6: And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
23:7: And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah.  And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
23:8: And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
23:9: And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
23:10: Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
23:11: Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand?  will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard?  O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant.  And the LORD said, He will come down.
23:12: Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?  And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.
23:13: Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go.  And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
23:14: And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph.  And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
23:15: And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. 
23:16: And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
23:17: And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth. 
23:18: And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. 
23:19: Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?
23:20: Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.
23:21: And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.
23:22: Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.
23:23: See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
23:24: And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
23:25: Saul also and his men went to seek him.  And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon.  And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
23:26: And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
23:27: But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
23:28: Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.
23:29: And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.
24:1: And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.
24:2: Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
24:3: And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
24:4: And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee.  Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.
24:5: And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
24:6: And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.
24:7: So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul.  But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
24:8: David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king.  And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
24:9: And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
24:10: Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.
24:11: Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it. 
24:12: The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.
24:13: As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. 
24:14: After whom is the king of Israel come out?  after whom dost thou pursue?  after a dead dog, after a flea. 
24:15: The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.
24:16: And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David?  And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
24:17: And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.
24:18: And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.
24:19: For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?  wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.
24:20: And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.
24:21: Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
24:22: And David sware unto Saul.  And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.
25:1: And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.  And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
25:2: And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
25:3: Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.
25:4: And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
25:5: And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
25:6: And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.
25:7: And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.
25:8: Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee.  Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
25:9: And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
25:10: And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?  and who is the son of Jesse?  there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.
25:11: Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be? 
25:12: So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.
25:13: And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword.  And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff. 
25:14: But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them. 
25:15: But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:
25:16: They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
25:17: Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.
25:18: Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
25:19: And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you.  But she told not her husband Nabal.
25:20: And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.
25:21: Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.
25:22: So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
25:23: And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
25:24: And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.
25:25: Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
25:26: Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
25:27: And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
25:28: I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.
25:29: Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.
25:30: And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
25:31: That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.
25:32: And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:
25:33: And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
25:34: For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. 
25:35: So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
25:36: And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. 
25:37: But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. 
25:38: And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.
25:39: And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head, And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
25:40: And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife.
25:41: And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
25:42: And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
25:43: David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
25:44: But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.
26:1: And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?
26:2: Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
26:3: And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way.  But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
26:4: David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.
26:5: And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.
26:6: Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?  And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
26:7: So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
26:8: Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.
26:9: And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?
26:10: David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
26:11: The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
26:12: So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.
26:13: Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:
26:14: And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner?  Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king? 
26:15: And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man?  and who is like to thee in Israel?  wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king?  for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
26:16: This thing is not good that thou hast done.  As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed.  And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster. 
26:17: And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David?  And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king. 
26:18: And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?  for what have I done?  or what evil is in mine hand?
26:19: Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant.  If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.
26:20: Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
26:21: Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
26:22: And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear!  and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
26:23: The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.
26:24: And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
26:25: Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail.  So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
27:1: And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.
27:2: And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
27:3: And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
27:4: And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
27:5: And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
27:6: Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
27:7: And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
27:8: And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.
27:9: And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
27:10: And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day?  And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
27:11: And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines. 
27:12: And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
28:1: And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel.  And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men. 
28:2: And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do.  And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.
28:3: Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.  And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
28:4: And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.
28:5: And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
28:6: And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
28:7: Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her.  And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.
28:8: And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.
28:9: And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
28:10: And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
28:11: Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee?  And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
28:12: And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me?  for thou art Saul.
28:13: And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou?  And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
28:14: And he said unto her, What form is he of?  And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle.  And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
28:15: And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?  And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.
28:16: Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?
28:17: And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:
28:18: Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.
28:19: Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
28:20: Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
28:21: And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me. 
28:22: Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
28:23: But he refused, and said, I will not eat.  But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice.  So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 
28:24: And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof: 
28:25: And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat.  Then they rose up, and went away that night.
29:1: Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.
29:2: And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.
29:3: Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?  And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?
29:4: And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master?  should it not be with the heads of these men?
29:5: Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
29:6: Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.
29:7: Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
29:8: And David said unto Achish, But what have I done?  and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
29:9: And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
29:10: Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
29:11: So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines.  And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
30:1: And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;
30:2: And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.
30:3: So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. 
30:4: Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
30:5: And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
30:6: And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God. 
30:7: And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod.  And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
30:8: And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop?  shall I overtake them?  And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.
30:9: So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
30:10: But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
30:11: And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;
30:12: And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
30:13: And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou?  and whence art thou?  And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.
30:14: We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
30:15: And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?  And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.
30:16: And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
30:17: And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
30:18: And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
30:19: And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
30:20: And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
30:21: And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
30:22: Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.
30:23: Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
30:24: For who will hearken unto you in this matter?  but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.
30:25: And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
30:26: And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD; 
30:27: To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,
30:28: And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa, 
30:29: And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites, 
30:30: And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chor-ashan, and to them which were in Athach,
30:31: And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.
31:1: Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
31:2: And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul's sons.
31:3: And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
31:4: Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me.  But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid.  Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
31:5: And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
31:6: So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.
31:7: And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
31:8: And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
31:9: And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.
31:10: And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
31:11: And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
31:12: All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
31:13: And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

SECOND SAMUEL
1:1: Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; 
1:2: It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
1:3: And David said unto him, From whence comest thou?  And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. 
1:4: And David said unto him, How went the matter?  I pray thee, tell me.  And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. 
1:5: And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
1:6: And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
1:7: And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.  And I answered, Here am I.
1:8: And he said unto me, Who art thou?  And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
1:9: And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.
1:10: So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
1:11: Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
1:12: And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
1:13: And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?  And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
1:14: And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?
1:15: And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him.  And he smote him that he died.
1:16: And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.
1:17: And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
1:18: (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
1:19: The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
1:20: Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
1:21: Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.
1:22: From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
1:23: Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
1:24: Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. 
1:25: How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!  O Jonathan, thou was slain in thine high places.
1:26: I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. 
1:27: How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! 
2:1: And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?  And the LORD said unto him, Go up.  And David said, Whither shall I go up?  And he said, Unto Hebron.
2:2: So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.
2:3: And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
2:4: And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.  And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.
2:5: And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.
2:6: And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. 
2:7: Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
2:8: But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 
2:9: And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. 
2:10: Ish-bosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years.  But the house of Judah followed David.
2:11: And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2:12: And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
2:13: And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
2:14: And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us.  And Joab said, Let them arise.
2:15: Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
2:16: And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
2:17: And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
2:18: And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
2:19: And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
2:20: Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel?  And he answered, I am.
2:21: And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour.  But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.
2:22: And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground?  how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
2:23: Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
2:24: Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
2:25: And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.
2:26: Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever?  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?  how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?
2:27: And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
2:28: So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
2:29: And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim. 
2:30: And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.
2:31: But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died. 
2:32: And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem.  And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day. 
3:1: Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
3:2: And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
3:3: And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
3:4: And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
3:5: And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife.  These were born to David in Hebron.
3:6: And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
3:7: And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?
3:8: Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?
3:9: So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;
3:10: To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.
3:11: And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
3:12: And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land?  saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.
3:13: And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
3:14: And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
3:15: And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
3:16: And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim.  Then said Abner unto him, Go, return.  And he returned.
3:17: And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:
3:18: Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
3:19: And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. 
3:20: So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him.  And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.
3:21: And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.  And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. 
3:22: And, Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. 
3:23: When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
3:24: Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?  behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
3:25: Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
3:26: And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.
3:27: And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
3:28: And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
3:29: Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.
3:30: So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
3:31: And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.  And king David himself followed the bier.
3:32: And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
3:33: And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?
3:34: Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou.  And all the people wept again over him.
3:35: And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.
3:36: And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.
3:37: For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
3:38: And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
3:39: And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.
4:1: And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
4:2: And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin: 
4:3: And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)
4:4: And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.  He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame.  And his name was Mephibosheth. 
4:5: And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.
4:6: And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
4:7: For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.
4:8: And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
4:9: And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 
4:10: When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:
4:11: How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed?  shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? 
4:12: And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron.  But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron. 
5:1: Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
5:2: Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
5:3: So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.
5:4: David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
5:5: In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
5:6: And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.
5:7: Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.
5:8: And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.  Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
5:9: So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.  And David built round about from Millo and inward.
5:10: And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.
5:11: And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.
5:12: And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
5:13: And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
5:14: And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
5:15: Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
5:16: And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
5:17: But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.
5:18: The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
5:19: And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines?  wilt thou deliver them into mine hand?  And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 
5:20: And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters.  Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
5:21: And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them. 
5:22: And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 
5:23: And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
5:24: And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.
5:25: And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.
6:1: Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
6:2: And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.
6:3: And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.
6:4: And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
6:5: And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.
6:6: And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
6:7: And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
6:8: And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day.
6:9: And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?
6:10: So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
6:11: And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his household.
6:12: And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God.  So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness.
6:13: And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
6:14: And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
6:15: So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
6:16: And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. 
6:17: And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
6:18: And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. 
6:19: And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.  So all the people departed every one to his house. 
6:20: Then David returned to bless his household.  And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
6:21: And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.
6:22: And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.
6:23: Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
7:1: And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;
7:2: That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
7:3: And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.
7:4: And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,
7:5: Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?
7:6: Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
7:7: In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?
7:8: Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
7:9: And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.
7:10: Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,
7:11: And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.  Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.
7:12: And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
7:13: He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
7:14: I will be his father, and he shall be my son.  If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
7:15: But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. 
7:16: And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
7:17: According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 
7:18: Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD?  and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
7:19: And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come.  And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?
7:20: And what can David say more unto thee?  for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.
7:21: For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.
7:22: Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
7:23: And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
7:24: For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God. 
7:25: And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said. 
7:26: And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
7:27: For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
7:28: And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
7:29: Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
8:1: And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
8:2: And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive.  And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
8:3: David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.
8:4: And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.
8:5: And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
8:6: Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts.  And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
8:7: And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
8:8: And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
8:9: When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
8:10: Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.  And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
8:11: Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;
8:12: Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
8:13: And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.
8:14: And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants.  And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
8:15: And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people. 
8:16: And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
8:17: And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe; 
8:18: And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers. 
9:1: And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
9:2: And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba.  And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?  And he said, Thy servant is he.
9:3: And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him?  And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.
9:4: And the king said unto him, Where is he?  And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.
9:5: Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.
9:6: Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.  And David said, Mephibosheth.  And he answered, Behold thy servant!
9:7: And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
9:8: And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?
9:9: Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.
9:10: Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table.  Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
9:11: Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.  As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
9:12: And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha.  And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.
9:13: So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.
10:1: And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
10:2: Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me.  And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father.  And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
10:3: And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee?  hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
10:4: Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
10:5: When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return. 
10:6: And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men.
10:7: And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 
10:8: And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field. 
10:9: When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
10:10: And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.
10:11: And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
10:12: Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.
10:13: And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
10:14: And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.  So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
10:15: And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
10:16: And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
10:17: And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam.  And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
10:18: And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
10:19: And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them.  So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
11:1: And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah.  But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
11:2: And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
11:3: And David sent and enquired after the woman.  And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
11:4: And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.
11:5: And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
11:6: And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite.  And Joab sent Uriah to David.
11:7: And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
11:8: And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.  And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king. 
11:9: But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
11:10: And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey?  why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?
11:11: And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?  as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
11:12: And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart.  So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
11:13: And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
11:14: And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. 
11:15: And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
11:16: And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were. 
11:17: And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. 
11:18: Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
11:19: And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,
11:20: And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight?  knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
11:21: Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?  did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez?  why went ye nigh the wall?  then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
11:22: So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.
11:23: And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.
11:24: And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
11:25: Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
11:26: And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
11:27: And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son.  But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.
12:1: And the LORD sent Nathan unto David.  And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
12:2: The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:
12:3: But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
12:4: And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
12:5: And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:
12:6: And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
12:7: And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man.  Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
12:8: And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
12:9: Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight?  thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 
12:10: Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
12:11: Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. 
12:12: For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun. 
12:13: And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.  And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
12:14: Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.
12:15: And Nathan departed unto his house.  And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
12:16: David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
12:17: And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
12:18: And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.  And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
12:19: But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead?  And they said, He is dead.
12:20: Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
12:21: Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done?  thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
12:22: And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
12:23: But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?  can I bring him back again?  I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
12:24: And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
12:25: And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
12:26: And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
12:27: And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
12:28: Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
12:29: And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
12:30: And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head.  And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
12:31: And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.  So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
13:1: And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
13:2: And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her. 
13:3: But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man. 
13:4: And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day?  wilt thou not tell me?  And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
13:5: And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.
13:6: So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
13:7: Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.
13:8: So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down.  And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
13:9: And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat.  And Amnon said, Have out all men from me.  And they went out every man from him.
13:10: And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand.  And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
13:11: And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.
13:12: And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.
13:13: And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go?  and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel.  Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
13:14: Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
13:15: Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her.  And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
13:16: And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me.  But he would not hearken unto her.
13:17: Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
13:18: And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled.  Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
13:19: And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
13:20: And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee?  but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing.  So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
13:21: But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
13:22: And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
13:23: And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
13:24: And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
13:25: And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee.  And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
13:26: Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us.  And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee? 
13:27: But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
13:28: Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you?  be courageous and be valiant. 
13:29: And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded.  Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled. 
13:30: And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
13:31: Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
13:32: And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
13:33: Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.
13:34: But Absalom fled.  And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.
13:35: And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.
13:36: And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
13:37: But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur.  And David mourned for his son every day.
13:38: So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
13:39: And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
14:1: Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.
14:2: And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:
14:3: And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him.  So Joab put the words in her mouth.
14:4: And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
14:5: And the king said unto her, What aileth thee?  And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.
14:6: And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.
14:7: And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.
14:8: And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
14:9: And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless. 
14:10: And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
14:11: Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son.  And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth. 
14:12: Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king.  And he said, Say on. 
14:13: And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God?  for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.
14:14: For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
14:15: Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
14:16: For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
14:17: Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.
14:18: Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee.  And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
14:19: And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?  And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:
14:20: To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
14:21: And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
14:22: And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.
14:23: So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
14:24: And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face.  So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
14:25: But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
14:26: And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
14:27: And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
14:28: So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
14:29: Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
14:30: Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire.  And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
14:31: Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
14:32: And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur?  it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me. 
14:33: So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
15:1: And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 
15:2: And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou?  And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
15:3: And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
15:4: Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
15:5: And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
15:6: And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
15:7: And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.
15:8: For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.
15:9: And the king said unto him, Go in peace.  So he arose, and went to Hebron.
15:10: But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
15:11: And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
15:12: And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counseller, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices.  And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
15:13: And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
15:14: And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
15:15: And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
15:16: And the king went forth, and all his household after him.  And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.
15:17: And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
15:18: And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
15:19: Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us?  return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.
15:20: Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us?  seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.
15:21: And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.
15:22: And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over.  And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
15:23: And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
15:24: And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
15:25: And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 
15:26: But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
15:27: The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?  return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 
15:28: See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. 
15:29: Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
15:30: And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
15:31: And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.  And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
15:32: And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:
15:33: Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:
15:34: But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
15:35: And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
15:36: Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.
15:37: So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
16:1: And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
16:2: And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these?  And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.
16:3: And the king said, And where is thy master's son?  And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
16:4: Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth.  And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
16:5: And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
16:6: And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
16:7: And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
16:8: The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.
16:9: Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?  let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
16:10: And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?  so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David.  Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? 
16:11: And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it?  let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.
16:12: It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day. 
16:13: And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. 
16:14: And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
16:15: And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
16:16: And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
16:17: And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?  why wentest thou not with thy friend?
16:18: And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
16:19: And again, whom should I serve?  should I not serve in the presence of his son?  as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.
16:20: Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
16:21: And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.
16:22: So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
16:23: And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
17:1: Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:
17:2: And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:
17:3: And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.
17:4: And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
17:5: Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.
17:6: And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying?  if not; speak thou.
17:7: And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.
17:8: For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
17:9: Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom. 
17:10: And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.
17:11: Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. 
17:12: So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one. 
17:13: Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.
17:14: And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.  For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.
17:15: Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
17:16: Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
17:17: Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.
17:18: Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.
17:19: And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.
17:20: And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan?  And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water.  And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
17:21: And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.
17:22: Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.
17:23: And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
17:24: Then David came to Mahanaim.  And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
17:25: And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.
17:26: So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
17:27: And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
17:28: Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,
17:29: And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
18:1: And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
18:2: And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.  And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
18:3: But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city. 
18:4: And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.  And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
18:5: And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.  And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. 
18:6: So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; 
18:7: Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.
18:8: For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
18:9: And Absalom met the servants of David.  And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
18:10: And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
18:11: And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground?  and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.
18:12: And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
18:13: Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.
18:14: Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee.  And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
18:15: And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
18:16: And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.
18:17: And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
18:18: Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.
18:19: Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.
18:20: And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
18:21: Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.  And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
18:22: Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi.  And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
18:23: But howsoever, said he, let me run.  And he said unto him, Run.  Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.
18:24: And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
18:25: And the watchman cried, and told the king.  And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth.  And he came apace, and drew near.
18:26: And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone.  And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. 
18:27: And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.  And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.
18:28: And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well.  And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. 
18:29: And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe?  And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. 
18:30: And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here.  And he turned aside, and stood still.
18:31: And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
18:32: And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?  And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.
18:33: And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!  would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
19:1: And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
19:2: And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.
19:3: And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
19:4: But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
19:5: And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;
19:6: In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends.  For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
19:7: Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.
19:8: Then the king arose, and sat in the gate.  And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.  And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
19:9: And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.
19:10: And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.  Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
19:11: And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house?  seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.
19:12: Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?
19:13: And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?  God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
19:14: And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.
19:15: So the king returned, and came to Jordan.  And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan. 
19:16: And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
19:17: And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king. 
19:18: And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good.  And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; 
19:19: And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
19:20: For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
19:21: But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?
19:22: And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me?  shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel?  for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
19:23: Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die.  And the king sware unto him.
19:24: And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.
19:25: And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?
19:26: And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.
19:27: And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.
19:28: For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table.  What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?
19:29: And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?  I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
19:30: And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.
19:31: And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.
19:32: Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
19:33: And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
19:34: And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
19:35: I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil?  can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink?  can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women?  wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
19:36: Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
19:37: Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother.  But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
19:38: And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee. 
19:39: And all the people went over Jordan.  And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
19:40: Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel. 
19:41: And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan? 
19:42: And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter?  have we eaten at all of the king's cost?  or hath he given us any gift?
19:43: And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?  And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
20:1: And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
20:2: So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
20:3: And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them.  So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
20:4: Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.
20:5: So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
20:6: And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.
20:7: And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
20:8: When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them.  And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
20:9: And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother?  And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
20:10: But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.  So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
20:11: And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.
20:12: And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway.  And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
20:13: When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
20:14: And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
20:15: And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
20:16: Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
20:17: And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab?  And he answered, I am he.  Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid.  And he answered, I do hear. 
20:18: Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.
20:19: I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD? 
20:20: And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. 
20:21: The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.  And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
20:22: Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom.  And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.  And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent.  And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
20:23: Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:
20:24: And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:
20:25: And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
20:26: And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.
21:1: Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD.  And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
21:2: And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
21:3: Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?  and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
21:4: And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel.  And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
21:5: And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
21:6: Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose.  And the king said, I will give them.
21:7: But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
21:8: But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
21:9: And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.
21:10: And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
21:11: And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
21:12: And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:
21:13: And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. 
21:14: And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded.  And after that God was intreated for the land.
21:15: Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint. 
21:16: And Ishbi-benob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David. 
21:17: But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him.  Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.
21:18: And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.
21:19: And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
21:20: And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
21:21: And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of David slew him.
21:22: These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
22:1: And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
22:2: And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
22:3: The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.
22:4: I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
22:5: When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
22:6: The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
22:7: In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.
22:8: Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
22:9: There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
22:10: He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet. 
22:11: And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
22:12: And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies. 
22:13: Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled. 
22:14: The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.
22:15: And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
22:16: And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
22:17: He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
22:18: He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
22:19: They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
22:20: He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
22:21: The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
22:22: For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
22:23: For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
22:24: I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.
22:25: Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
22:26: With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.
22:27: With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.
22:28: And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.
22:29: For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
22:30: For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.
22:31: As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.
22:32: For who is God, save the LORD?  and who is a rock, save our God?
22:33: God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. 
22:34: He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.
22:35: He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. 
22:36: Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. 
22:37: Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
22:38: I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
22:39: And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.
22:40: For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
22:41: Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
22:42: They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
22:43: Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.
22:44: Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.
22:45: Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
22:46: Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
22:47: The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
22:48: It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
22:49: And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
22:50: Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.
22:51: He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
23:1: Now these be the last words of David.  David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
23:2: The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.
23:3: The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
23:4: And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain. 
23:5: Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.
23:6: But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands: 
23:7: But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place. 
23:8: These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
23:9: And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:
23:10: He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
23:11: And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite.  And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.
23:12: But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.
23:13: And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
23:14: And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
23:15: And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
23:16: And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.
23:17: And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?  therefore he would not drink it.  These things did these three mighty men.
23:18: And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three.  And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.
23:19: Was he not most honourable of three?  therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.
23:20: And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
23:21: And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
23:22: These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.
23:23: He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three.  And David set him over his guard.
23:24: Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
23:25: Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
23:26: Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
23:27: Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
23:28: Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
23:29: Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, 
23:30: Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, 
23:31: Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
23:32: Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
23:33: Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
23:34: Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
23:35: Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
23:36: Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
23:37: Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
23:38: Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,
23:39: Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
24:1: And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
24:2: For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
24:3: And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
24:4: Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host.  And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
24:5: And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:
24:6: Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,
24:7: And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hibites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beer-sheba.
24:8: So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
24:9: And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
24:10: And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.  And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. 
24:11: For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
24:12: Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. 
24:13: So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land?  or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee?  or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land?  now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
24:14: And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
24:15: So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
24:16: And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand.  And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
24:17: And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done?  let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house. 
24:18: And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.
24:19: And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded. 
24:20: And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground. 
24:21: And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?  And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
24:22: And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.
24:23: All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.  And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.
24:24: And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing.  So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
24:25: And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.  So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

FIRST KINGS
1:1: Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
1:2: Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. 
1:3: So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
1:4: And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not. 
1:5: Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
1:6: And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so?  and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.
1:7: And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
1:8: But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
1:9: And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
1:10: But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
1:11: Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?
1:12: Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
1:13: Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?  why then doth Adonijah reign?
1:14: Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
1:15: And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
1:16: And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king.  And the king said, What wouldest thou?
1:17: And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
1:18: And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:
1:19: And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
1:20: And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
1:21: Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
1:22: And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
1:23: And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet.  And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
1:24: And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
1:25: For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah. 
1:26: But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
1:27: Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him? 
1:28: Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba.  And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. 
1:29: And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
1:30: Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
1:31: Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
1:32: And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.  And they came before the king.
1:33: The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
1:34: And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
1:35: Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
1:36: And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.
1:37: As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
1:38: So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
1:39: And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon.  And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
1:40: And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
1:41: And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating.  And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
1:42: And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
1:43: And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
1:44: And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
1:45: And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again.  This is the noise that ye have heard.
1:46: And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
1:47: And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne.  And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
1:48: And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it. 
1:49: And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
1:50: And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
1:51: And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword. 
1:52: And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
1:53: So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.  And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.
2:1: Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
2:2: I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;
2:3: And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
2:4: That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
2:5: Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
2:6: Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.
2:7: But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
2:8: And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
2:9: Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.
2:10: So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
2:11: And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
2:12: Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
2:13: And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon.  And she said, Comest thou peaceably?  And he said, Peaceably.
2:14: He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee.  And she said, Say on.
2:15: And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.
2:16: And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not.  And she said unto him, Say on.
2:17: And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. 
2:18: And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
2:19: Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah.  And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 
2:20: Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay.  And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.
2:21: And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
2:22: And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?  ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
2:23: Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
2:24: Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. 
2:25: And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
2:26: And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. 
2:27: So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. 
2:28: Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom.  And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
2:29: And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar.  Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
2:30: And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth.  And he said, Nay; but I will die here.  And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
2:31: And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
2:32: And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
2:33: Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.
2:34: So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
2:35: And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
2:36: And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.
2:37: For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
2:38: And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do.  And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
2:39: And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.  And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.
2:40: And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
2:41: And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
2:42: And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any wither, that thou shalt surely die?  and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.
2:43: Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
2:44: The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;
2:45: And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.
2:46: So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died.  And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
3:1: And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
3:2: Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days. 
3:3: And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. 
3:4: And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
3:5: In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
3:6: And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
3:7: And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.
3:8: And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
3:9: Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
3:10: And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
3:11: And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
3:12: Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
3:13: And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.
3:14: And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
3:15: And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream.  And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
3:16: Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
3:17: And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
3:18: And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
3:19: And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
3:20: And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
3:21: And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
3:22: And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son.  And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son.  Thus they spake before the king.
3:23: Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. 
3:24: And the king said, Bring me a sword.  And they brought a sword before the king.
3:25: And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. 
3:26: Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it.  But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it. 
3:27: Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
3:28: And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.
4:1: So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
4:2: And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
4:3: Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
4:4: And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
4:5: And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:
4:6: And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.
4:7: And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.
4:8: And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
4:9: The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:
4:10: The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
4:11: The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
4:12: Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:
4:13: The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:
4:14: Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:
4:15: Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
4:16: Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:
4:17: Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 
4:18: Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
4:19: Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land. 
4:20: Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 
4:21: And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
4:22: And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
4:23: Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.
4:24: For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
4:25: And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. 
4:26: And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
4:27: And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 
4:28: Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. 
4:29: And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.
4:30: And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
4:31: For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.
4:32: And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
4:33: And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
4:34: And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
5:1: And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
5:2: And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
5:3: Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
5:4: But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
5:5: And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.
5:6: Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
5:7: And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
5:8: And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
5:9: My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
5:10: So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.
5:11: And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
5:12: And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
5:13: And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 
5:14: And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.
5:15: And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 
5:16: Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work. 
5:17: And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
5:18: And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.
6:1: And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
6:2: And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.
6:3: And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.
6:4: And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
6:5: And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
6:6: The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
6:7: And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
6:8: The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.
6:9: So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
6:10: And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
6:11: And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
6:12: Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:
6:13: And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
6:14: So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
6:15: And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
6:16: And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
6:17: And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long. 
6:18: And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
6:19: And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
6:20: And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar. 
6:21: So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
6:22: And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
6:23: And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.
6:24: And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
6:25: And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.
6:26: The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
6:27: And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
6:28: And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
6:29: And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
6:30: And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
6:31: And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
6:32: The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.
6:33: So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.
6:34: And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
6:35: And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
6:36: And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
6:37: In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:
6:38: And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it.  So was he seven years in building it.
7:1: But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. 
7:2: He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
7:3: And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row. 
7:4: And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks. 
7:5: And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.
7:6: And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
7:7: Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
7:8: And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work.  Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.
7:9: All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
7:10: And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
7:11: And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.
7:12: And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house. 
7:13: And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
7:14: He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass.  And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. 
7:15: For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about. 
7:16: And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:
7:17: And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.
7:18: And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.
7:19: And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.
7:20: And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
7:21: And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz.
7:22: And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
7:23: And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
7:24: And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
7:25: It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
7:26: And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
7:27: And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
7:28: And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:
7:29: And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
7:30: And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
7:31: And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
7:32: And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit.
7:33: And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.
7:34: And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.
7:35: And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same. 
7:36: For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.
7:37: After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size. 
7:38: Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. 
7:39: And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
7:40: And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons.  So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:
7:41: The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;
7:42: And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;
7:43: And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
7:44: And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
7:45: And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.
7:46: In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
7:47: And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
7:48: And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,
7:49: And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
7:50: And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.
7:51: So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD.  And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.
8:1: Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
8:2: And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
8:3: And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
8:4: And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
8:5: And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
8:6: And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims. 
8:7: For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
8:8: And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day. 
8:9: There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. 
8:10: And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
8:11: So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
8:12: Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thick darkness.
8:13: I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
8:14: And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
8:15: And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
8:16: Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
8:17: And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
8:18: And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.
8:19: Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
8:20: And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
8:21: And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
8:22: And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:
8:23: And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:
8:24: Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.
8:25: Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
8:26: And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
8:27: But will God indeed dwell on the earth?  behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?
8:28: Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:
8:29: That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.
8:30: And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.
8:31: If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:
8:32: Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
8:33: When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house: 
8:34: Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.
8:35: When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 
8:36: Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. 
8:37: If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;
8:38: What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
8:39: Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
8:40: That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
8:41: Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;
8:42: (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;
8:43: Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.
8:44: If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:
8:45: Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
8:46: If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;
8:47: Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
8:48: And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:
8:49: Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,
8:50: And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
8:51: For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
8:52: That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.
8:53: For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.
8:54: And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.
8:55: And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
8:56: Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. 
8:57: The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:
8:58: That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers. 
8:59: And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require: 
8:60: That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.
8:61: Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
8:62: And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
8:63: And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep.  So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
8:64: The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
8:65: And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
8:66: On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.
9:1: And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,
9:2: That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.
9:3: And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
9:4: And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:
9:5: Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
9:6: But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
9:7: Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:
9:8: And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?
9:9: And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.
9:10: And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
9:11: (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
9:12: And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. 
9:13: And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother?  And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
9:14: And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. 
9:15: And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. 
9:16: For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.
9:17: And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,
9:18: and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
9:19: And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
9:20: And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,
9:21: Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.
9:22: But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
9:23: These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.
9:24: But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.
9:25: And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD.  So he finished the house.
9:26: And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
9:27: And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
9:28: And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
10:1: And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.
10:2: And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
10:3: And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
10:4: And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
10:5: And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. 
10:6: And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
10:7: Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard. 
10:8: Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. 
10:9: Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.
10:10: And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
10:11: And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
10:12: And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.
10:13: And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty.  So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
10:14: Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold.
10:15: Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
10:16: And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.
10:17: And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
10:18: Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
10:19: The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
10:20: And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
10:21: And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
10:22: For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
10:23: So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
10:24: And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
10:25: And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
10:26: And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
10:27: And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
10:28: And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
10:29: And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
11:1: But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; 
11:2: Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
11:3: And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
11:4: For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.
11:5: For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
11:6: And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.
11:7: Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
11:8: And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
11:9: And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,
11:10: And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
11:11: Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
11:12: Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
11:13: Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
11:14: And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.
11:15: For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
11:16: (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
11:17: That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.
11:18: And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
11:19: And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
11:20: And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
11:21: And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. 
11:22: Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country?  And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.
11:23: And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 
11:24: And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. 
11:25: And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
11:26: And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.
11:27: And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
11:28: And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
11:29: And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:
11:30: And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:
11:31: And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:
11:32: (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
11:33: Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.
11:34: Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
11:35: But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.
11:36: And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
11:37: And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
11:38: And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
11:39: And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
11:40: Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam.  And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
11:41: And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
11:42: And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
11:43: And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
12:1: And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
12:2: And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
12:3: That they sent and called him.  And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,
12:4: Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
12:5: And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.  And the people departed.
12:6: And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? 
12:7: And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
12:8: But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him: 
12:9: And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? 
12:10: And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
12:11: And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
12:12: So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
12:13: And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
12:14: And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
12:15: Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
12:16: So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?  neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David.  So Israel departed unto their tents.
12:17: But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
12:18: Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.  Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
12:19: So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
12:20: And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
12:21: And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
12:22: But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
12:23: Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
12:24: Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.  They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.
12:25: Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
12:26: And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:
12:27: If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.
12:28: Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
12:29: And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. 
12:30: And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.
12:31: And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 
12:32: And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar.  So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. 
12:33: So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
13:1: And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
13:2: And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
13:3: And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
13:4: And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.  And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.
13:5: The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
13:6: And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.  And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.
13:7: And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
13:8: And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:
13:9: For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.
13:10: So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.
13:11: Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.
13:12: And their father said unto them, What way went he?  For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.
13:13: And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass.  So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,
13:14: And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?  And he said, I am.
13:15: Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
13:16: And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:
13:17: For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.
13:18: He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water.  But he lied unto him. 
13:19: So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
13:20: And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: 
13:21: And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 
13:22: But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the LORD did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
13:23: And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
13:24: And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.
13:25: And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
13:26: And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.
13:27: And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass.  And they saddled him.
13:28: And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.
13:29: And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
13:30: And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!
13:31: And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:
13:32: For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
13:33: After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
13:34: And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the ear
14:1: At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
14:2: And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.
14:3: And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.
14:4: And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah.  But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
14:5: And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.
14:6: And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another?  for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. 
14:7: Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
14:8: And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes; 
14:9: But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 
14:10: Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.
14:11: Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.
14:12: Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
14:13: And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
14:14: Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what?  even now.
14:15: For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
14:16: And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.
14:17: And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;
14:18: And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
14:19: And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
14:20: And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with this fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
14:21: And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.  Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.  And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
14:22: And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.
14:23: For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
14:24: And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
14:25: And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
14:26: And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
14:27: And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.
14:28: And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
14:29: Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
14:30: And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
14:31: And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David.  And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.  And Abijam his son reigned in his stead. 
15:1: Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
15:2: Three years reigned he in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
15:3: And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
15:4: Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
15:5: Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
15:6: And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
15:7: Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
15:8: And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
15:9: And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
15:10: And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
15:11: And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father.
15:12: And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
15:13: And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
15:14: But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.
15:15: And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.
15:16: And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
15:17: And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
15:18: Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
15:19: There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
15:20: So Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 
15:21: And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
15:22: Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. 
15:23: The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
15:24: And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
15:25: And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
15:26: And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
15:27: And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
15:28: Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
15:29: And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
15:30: Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.
15:31: Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
15:32: And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
15:33: In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.
15:34: And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
16:1: Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
16:2: Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
16:3: Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
16:4: Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
16:5: Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
16:6: So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
16:7: And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
16:8: In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. 
16:9: And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.
16:10: And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
16:11: And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
16:12: Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
16:13: For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
16:14: Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
16:15: In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah.  And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 
16:16: And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
16:17: And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
16:18: And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,
16:19: For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
16:20: Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
16:21: Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
16:22: But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
16:23: In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
16:24: And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
16:25: But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.
16:26: For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
16:27: Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
16:28: So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
16:29: And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
16:30: And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.
16:31: And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
16:32: And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
16:33: And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
16:34: In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.
17:1: And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. 
17:2: And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
17:3: Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. 
17:4: And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. 
17:5: So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
17:6: And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
17:7: And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
17:8: And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
17:9: Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
17:10: So he arose and went to Zarephath.  And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
17:11: And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
17:12: And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
17:13: And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
17:14: For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.
17:15: And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
17:16: And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.
17:17: And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
17:18: And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God?  art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
17:19: And he said unto her, Give me thy son.  And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
17:20: And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
17:21: And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
17:22: And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
17:23: And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
17:24: And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth. 
18:1: And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth. 
18:2: And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab.  And there was a sore famine in Samaria. 
18:3: And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.  (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:
18:4: For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
18:5: And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
18:6: So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
18:7: And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?
18:8: And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
18:9: And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
18:10: As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
18:11: And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
18:12: And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.
18:13: Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
18:14: And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.
18:15: And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.
18:16: So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
18:17: And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?
18:18: And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.
18:19: Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.
18:20: So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
18:21: And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions?  if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.  And the people answered him not a word.
18:22: Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. 
18:23: Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
18:24: And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God.  And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken. 
18:25: And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under. 
18:26: And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us.  But there was no voice, nor any that answered.  And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
18:27: And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
18:28: And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
18:29: And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
18:30: And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me.  And all the people came near unto him.  And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.
18:31: And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: 
18:32: And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
18:33: And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. 
18:34: And he said, Do it the second time.  And they did it the second time.  And he said, Do it the third time.  And they did it the third time. 
18:35: And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
18:36: And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.
18:37: Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.
18:38: Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
18:39: And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.
18:40: And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.  And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
18:41: And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
18:42: So Ahab went up to eat and to drink.  And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
18:43: And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea.  And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing.  And he said, Go again seven times.
18:44: And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.  And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.
18:45: And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.  And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
18:46: And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
19:1: And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
19:2: Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.
19:3: And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.
19:4: But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
19:5: And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.
19:6: And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head.  And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.
19:7: And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee. 
19:8: And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
19:9: And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? 
19:10: And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. 
19:11: And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.  And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:
19:12: And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
19:13: And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.  And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
19:14: And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
19:15: And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:
19:16: And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
19:17: And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
19:18: Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
19:19: So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
19:20: And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.  And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?
19:21: And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat.  Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
20:1: And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
20:2: And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,
20:3: Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.
20:4: And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.
20:5: And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
20:6: Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
20:7: Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
20:8: And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent. 
20:9: Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do.  And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
20:10: And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me. 
20:11: And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off. 
20:12: And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array.  And they set themselves in array against the city.
20:13: And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?  behold, I will deliver it in to thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.
20:14: And Ahab said, By whom?  And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces.  Then he said, Who shall order the battle?  And he answered, Thou.
20:15: Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
20:16: And they went out at noon.  But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
20:17: And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
20:18: And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.
20:19: So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
20:20: And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.
20:21: And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
20:22: And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thy self, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
20:23: And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
20:24: And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:
20:25: And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.  And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
20:26: And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
20:27: And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
20:28: And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
20:29: And they pitched one over against the other seven days.  And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.
20:30: But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left.  And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
20:31: And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. 
20:32: So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live.  And he said, Is he yet alive?  he is my brother.
20:33: Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad.  Then he said, Go ye, bring him.  Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. 
20:34: And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.  Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant.  So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away. 
20:35: And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee.  And the man refused to smite him.
20:36: Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.  And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
20:37: Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.  And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.
20:38: So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
20:39: And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
20:40: And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone.  And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.
20:41: And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
20:42: And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
20:43: And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.
21:1: And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
21:2: And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
21:3: And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
21:4: And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.  And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
21:5: But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
21:6: And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
21:7: And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel?  arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
21:8: So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
21:9: And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
21:10: And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king.  And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die. 
21:11: And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
21:12: They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 
21:13: And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king.  Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. 
21:14: Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
21:15: And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
21:16: And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
21:17: And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
21:18: Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.
21:19: And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?  And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
21:20: And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?  And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.
21:21: Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
21:22: And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
21:23: And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
21:24: Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
21:25: But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
21:26: And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
21:27: And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
21:28: And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
21:29: Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me?  because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.
22:1: And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
22:2: And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
22:3: And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? 
22:4: And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead?  And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
22:5: And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. 
22:6: Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?  And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 
22:7: And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
22:8: And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.  And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
22:9: Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.
22:10: And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
22:11: And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.
22:12: And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.
22:13: And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.
22:14: And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.
22:15: So he came to the king.  And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?  And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
22:16: And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?
22:17: And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
22:18: And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?
22:19: And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
22:20: And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?  And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.
22:21: And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.
22:22: And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?  And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.  And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
22:23: Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.
22:24: But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
22:25: And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. 
22:26: And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
22:27: And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. 
22:28: And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me.  And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you. 
22:29: So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
22:30: And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.  And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
22:31: But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
22:32: And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.  And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
22:33: And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
22:34: And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
22:35: And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
22:36: And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
22:37: So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
22:38: And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.
22:39: Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
22:40: So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
22:41: And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
22:42: Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
22:43: And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
22:44: And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
22:45: Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
22:46: And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.
22:47: There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
22:48: Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. 
22:49: Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships.  But Jehoshaphat would not.
22:50: And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 
22:51: Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. 
22:52: And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
22:53: For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

SECOND KINGS
1:1: Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
1:2: And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.
1:3: But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
1:4: Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.  And Elijah departed.
1:5: And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?
1:6: And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?  therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
1:7: And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?
1:8: And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.  And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
1:9: Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty.  And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill.  And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
1:10: And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty.  And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
1:11: Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty.  And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
1:12: And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty.  And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
1:13: And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.  And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
1:14: Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.
1:15: And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him.  And he arose, and went down with him unto the king. 
1:16: And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word?  therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
1:17: So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken.  And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son. 
1:18: Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2:1: And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
2:2: And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel.  And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  So they went down to Bethel.
2:3: And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day?  And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
2:4: And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho.  And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  So they came to Jericho.
2:5: And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day?  And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
2:6: And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan.  And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  And they two went on.
2:7: And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.
2:8: And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
2:9: And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.  And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
2:10: And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
2:11: And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
2:12: And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.  And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
2:13: He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
2:14: And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah?  and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.
2:15: And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.  And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
2:16: And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.  And he said, Ye shall not send.
2:17: And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.  They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
2:18: And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
2:19: And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.
2:20: And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein.  And they brought it to him.
2:21: And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land. 
2:22: So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.
2:23: And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. 
2:24: And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD.  And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them. 
2:25: And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.
3:1: Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
3:2: And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.
3:3: Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
3:4: And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
3:5: But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
3:6: And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.
3:7: And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?  And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.
3:8: And he said, Which way shall we go up?  And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
3:9: So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.
3:10: And the king of Israel said, Alas!  that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
3:11: But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him?  And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.
3:12: And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him.  So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
3:13: And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee?  get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother.  And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
3:14: And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.
3:15: But now bring me a minstrel.  And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.
3:16: And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.
3:17: For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
3:18: And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand. 
3:19: And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
3:20: And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. 
3:21: And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border. 
3:22: And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:
3:23: And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
3:24: And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.
3:25: And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.
3:26: And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.
3:27: Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall.  And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
4:1: Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.
4:2: And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee?  tell me, what hast thou in the house?  And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.
4:3: Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
4:4: And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
4:5: So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.
4:6: And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel.  And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more.  And the oil stayed.
4:7: Then she came and told the man of God.  And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.
4:8: And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread.  And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
4:9: And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.
4:10: Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
4:11: And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
4:12: And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite.  And when he had called her, she stood before him.
4:13: And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?  wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?  And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. 
4:14: And he said, What then is to be done for her?  And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
4:15: And he said, Call her.  And when he had called her, she stood in the door. 
4:16: And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son.  And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid. 
4:17: And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.
4:18: And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
4:19: And he said unto his father, My head, my head.  And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.
4:20: And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.
4:21: And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.
4:22: And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
4:23: And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day?  it is neither new moon, nor sabbath.  And she said, It shall be well.
4:24: Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.
4:25: So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel.  And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:
4:26: Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee?  is it well with thy husband?  is it well with the child?  And she answered, It is well.
4:27: And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away.  And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.
4:28: Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord?  did I not say, Do not deceive me?
4:29: Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
4:30: And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  And he arose, and followed her.
4:31: And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.  Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
4:32: And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.
4:33: He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.
4:34: And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
4:35: Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
4:36: And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite.  So he called her.  And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son. 
4:37: Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
4:38: And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.
4:39: And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.
4:40: So they poured out for the men to eat.  And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot.  And they could not eat thereof.
4:41: But he said, Then bring meal.  And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat.  And there was no harm in the pot.
4:42: And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof.  And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat. 
4:43: And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?  He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.
4:44: So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD. 
5:1: Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.
5:2: And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.
5:3: And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria!  for he would recover him of his leprosy.
5:4: And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.
5:5: And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.  And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
5:6: And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
5:7: And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy?  wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
5:8: And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes?  let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
5:9: So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
5:10: And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
5:11: But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
5:12: Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?  may I not wash in them, and be clean?  So he turned and went away in a rage.
5:13: And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it?  how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
5:14: Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
5:15: And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.
5:16: But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none.  And he urged him to take it; but he refused.
5:17: And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth?  for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.
5:18: In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.
5:19: And he said unto him, Go in peace.  So he departed from him a little way.
5:20: But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. 
5:21: So Gehazi followed after Naaman.  And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
5:22: And he said, All is well.  My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. 
5:23: And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents.  And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him. 
5:24: And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.
5:25: But he went in, and stood before his master.  And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi?  And he said, Thy servant went no whither.
5:26: And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?  Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?
5:27: The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever.  And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.
6:1: And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.
6:2: Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.  And he answered, Go ye.
6:3: And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.  And he answered, I will go.
6:4: So he went with them.  And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.
6:5: But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master!  for it was borrowed.
6:6: And the man of God said, Where fell it?  And he shewed him the place.  And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.
6:7: Therefore said he, Take it up to thee.  And he put out his hand, and took it.
6:8: Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
6:9: And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.
6:10: And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
6:11: Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?
6:12: And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
6:13: And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him.  And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
6:14: Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
6:15: And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots.  And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master!  how shall we do? 
6:16: And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.
6:17: And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see.  And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. 
6:18: And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness.  And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. 
6:19: And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek.  But he led them to Samaria.
6:20: And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.  And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
6:21: And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them?  shall I smite them?
6:22: And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow?  set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
6:23: And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master.  So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
6:24: And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
6:25: And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
6:26: And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
6:27: And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee?  out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?
6:28: And the king said unto her, What aileth thee?  And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.
6:29: So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.
6:30: And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
6:31: Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
6:32: But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head?  look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
6:33: And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?
7:1: Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
7:2: Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?  And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
7:3: And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? 
7:4: If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also.  Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
7:5: And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there. 
7:6: For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us. 
7:7: Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
7:8: And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.
7:9: Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.
7:10: So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.
7:11: And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.
7:12: And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us.  They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.
7:13: And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.
7:14: They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
7:15: And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste.  And the messengers returned, and told the king.
7:16: And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.  So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
7:17: And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.
7:18: And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:
7:19: And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?  And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
7:20: And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.
8:1: Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
8:2: And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
8:3: And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.
8:4: And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
8:5: And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land.  And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life. 
8:6: And when the king asked the woman, she told him.  So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.
8:7: And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither. 
8:8: And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? 
8:9: So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
8:10: And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.
8:11: And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
8:12: And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord?  And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.
8:13: And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?  And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.
8:14: So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee?  And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.
8:15: And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.
8:16: And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
8:17: Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
8:18: And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
8:19: Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.
8:20: In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
8:21: So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.
8:22: Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.  Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
8:23: And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
8:24: And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
8:25: In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
8:26: Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
8:27: And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab.
8:28: And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. 
8:29: And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria.  And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
9:1: And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead: 
9:2: And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;
9:3: Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.  Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
9:4: So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
9:5: And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain.  And Jehu said, Unto which of all us?  And he said, To thee, O captain.
9:6: And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.
9:7: And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.
9:8: For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:
9:9: And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:
9:10: And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.  And he opened the door, and fled.
9:11: Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well?  wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?  And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.
9:12: And they said, It is false; tell us now.  And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
9:13: Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.
9:14: So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram.  (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
9:15: But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.
9:16: So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.  And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
9:17: And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company.  And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace? 
9:18: So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace?  And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace?  turn thee behind me.  And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.
9:19: Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace?  And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace?  turn thee behind me. 
9:20: And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. 
9:21: And Joram said, Make ready.  And his chariot was made ready.  And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
9:22: And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu?  And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
9:23: And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
9:24: And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
9:25: Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;
9:26: Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD.  Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.
9:27: But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house.  And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot.  And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam.  And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
9:28: And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
9:29: And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
9:30: And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.
9:31: And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?
9:32: And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?  who?  And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.
9:33: And he said, Throw her down.  So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.
9:34: And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.
9:35: And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
9:36: Wherefore they came again, and told him.  And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:
9:37: And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.
10:1: And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.  And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,
10:2: Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour; 
10:3: Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
10:4: But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand? 
10:5: And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes. 
10:6: Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time.  Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.
10:7: And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.
10:8: And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons.  And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.
10:9: And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?
10:10: Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.
10:11: So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
10:12: And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria.  And as he was at the shearing house in the way,
10:13: Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye?  And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
10:14: And he said, Take them alive.  And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
10:15: And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?  And Jehonadab answered, It is.  If it be, give me thine hand.  And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
10:16: And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD.  So they made him ride in his chariot.
10:17: And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.
10:18: And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.
10:19: Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.  But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
10:20: And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.  And they proclaimed it.
10:21: And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not.  And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
10:22: And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.  And he brought them forth vestments.
10:23: And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.
10:24: And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.
10:25: And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth.  And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal. 
10:26: And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.
10:27: And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day. 
10:28: Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. 
10:29: Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.
10:30: And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.
10:31: But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.
10:32: In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;
10:33: From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
10:34: Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
10:35: And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria.  And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
10:36: And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.
11:1: And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.
11:2: But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
11:3: And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years.  And Athaliah did reign over the land.
11:4: And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.
11:5: And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
11:6: And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.
11:7: And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.
11:8: And ye shall compass the king around about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.
11:9: And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
11:10: And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD. 
11:11: And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.
11:12: And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king. 
11:13: And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD. 
11:14: And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.
11:15: But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword.  For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.
11:16: And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.
11:17: And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they should be the LORD's people; between the king also and the people.
11:18: And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.  And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.
11:19: And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house.  And he sat on the throne of the kings.
11:20: And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.
11:21: Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.
12:1: In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
12:2: And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
12:3: But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
12:4: And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,
12:5: Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.
12:6: But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
12:7: Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house?  now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
12:8: And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.
12:9: But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.
12:10: And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.
12:11: And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD, 
12:12: And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
12:13: Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD: 
12:14: But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD. 
12:15: Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.
12:16: The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.
12:17: Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
12:18: And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.
12:19: And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
12:20: And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.
12:21: For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
13:1: In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.
13:2: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
13:3: And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all their days.
13:4: And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
13:5: (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.
13:6: Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)
13:7: Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.
13:8: Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
13:9: And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
13:10: In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.
13:11: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.
13:12: And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
13:13: And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
13:14: Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.  And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. 
13:15: And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows.  And he took unto him bow and arrows. 
13:16: And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow.  And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.
13:17: And he said, Open the window eastward.  And he opened it.  Then Elisha said, Shoot.  And he shot.  And he said, The arrow of the LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.
13:18: And he said, Take the arrows.  And he took them.  And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground.  And he smote thrice, and stayed.
13:19: And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.
13:20: And Elisha died, and they buried him.  And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
13:21: And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
13:22: But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
13:23: And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.
13:24: So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.
13:25: And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war.  Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.
14:1: In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.
14:2: He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
14:3: And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.
14:4: Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.
14:5: And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.
14:6: But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
14:7: He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.
14:8: Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
14:9: And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
14:10: Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee? 
14:11: But Amaziah would not hear.  Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
14:12: And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents. 
14:13: And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
14:14: And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
14:15: Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
14:16: And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
14:17: And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
14:18: And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
14:19: Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
14:20: And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
14:21: And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
14:22: He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
14:23: In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.
14:24: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
14:25: He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gath-hepher.
14:26: For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.
14:27: And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
14:28: Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
14:29: And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.
15:1: In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
15:2: Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
15:3: And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done; 
15:4: Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.
15:5: And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house.  And Jotham the king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land. 
15:6: And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
15:7: So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
15:8: In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
15:9: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
15:10: And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
15:11: And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
15:12: This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation.  And so it came to pass.
15:13: Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.
15:14: For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
15:15: And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
15:16: Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.
15:17: In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.
15:18: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
15:19: And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
15:20: And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria.  So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.
15:21: And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
15:22: And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
15:23: In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.
15:24: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
15:25: But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.
15:26: And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
15:27: In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.
15:28: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 
15:29: In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Jonoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. 
15:30: And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
15:31: And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
15:32: In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
15:33: Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
15:34: And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
15:35: Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places.  He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.
15:36: Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
15:37: In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
15:38: And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
16:1: In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
16:2: Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.
16:3: But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.
16:4: And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
16:5: Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
16:6: At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.
16:7: So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.
16:8: And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.
16:9: And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
16:10: And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof. 
16:11: And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.
16:12: And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.
16:13: and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar.
16:14: And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.
16:15: And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by. 
16:16: Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
16:17: And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones. 
16:18: And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria. 
16:19: Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
16:20: And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
17:1: In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
17:2: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
17:3: Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.
17:4: And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
17:5: Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
17:6: In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
17:7: For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
17:8: And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
17:9: And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
17:10: And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:
17:11: And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:
17:12: For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
17:13: Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
17:14: Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.
17:15: And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.
17:16: And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
17:17: And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 
17:18: Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
17:19: Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made. 
17:20: And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight. 
17:21: For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.
17:22: For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
17:23: Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets.  So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.
17:24: And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
17:25: And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.
17:26: Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
17:27: Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
17:28: Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.
17:29: Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
17:30: And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
17:31: And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
17:32: So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
17:33: They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.
17:34: Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
17:35: With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
17:36: But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
17:37: And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.
17:38: And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.
17:39: But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
17:40: Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner. 
17:41: So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.
18:1: Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. 
18:2: Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem.  His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
18:3: And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.
18:4: He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
18:5: He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.
18:6: For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.
18:7: And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
18:8: He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
18:9: And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
18:10: And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
18:11: And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
18:12: Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.
18:13: Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.
18:14: And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear.  And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
18:15: And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.
18:16: At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
18:17: And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem.  And they went up and came to Jerusalem.  And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.
18:18: And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
18:19: And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
18:20: Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war.  Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
18:21: Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him. 
18:22: But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
18:23: Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 
18:24: How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
18:25: Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it?  The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
18:26: Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
18:27: But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words?  hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you.
18:28: Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
18:29: Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
18:30: Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
18:31: Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:
18:32: Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.
18:33: Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
18:34: Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad?  where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?  have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?
18:35: Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?
18:36: But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
18:37: Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.
19:1: And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
19:2: And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
19:3: And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
19:4: It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.
19:5: So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
19:6: And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. 
19:7: Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
19:8: So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 
19:9: And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying, 
19:10: Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
19:11: Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
19:12: Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?
19:13: Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
19:14: And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
19:15: And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.
19:16: LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.
19:17: Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,
19:18: And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
19:19: Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.
19:20: Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
19:21: This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
19:22: Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed?  and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?  even against the Holy One of Israel.
19:23: By the messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.
19:24: I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
19:25: Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it?  now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.
19:26: Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
19:27: But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
19:28: Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
19:29: And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof. 
19:30: And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
19:31: For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this. 
19:32: Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. 
19:33: By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
19:34: For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
19:35: And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
19:36: So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
19:37: And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia.  And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
20:1: In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death.  And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
20:2: Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,
20:3: I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight.  And Hezekiah wept sore.
20:4: And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
20:5: Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.
20:6: And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
20:7: And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs.  And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
20:8: And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?
20:9: And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forth ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
20:10: And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
20:11: And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.
20:12: At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
20:13: And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. 
20:14: Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men?  and from whence came they unto thee?  And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.
20:15: And he said, What have they seen in thine house?  And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them. 
20:16: And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD. 
20:17: Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.
20:18: And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
20:19: Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken.  And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?
20:20: And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
20:21: And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
21:1: Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Hephzi-bah.
21:2: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
21:3: For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
21:4: And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
21:5: And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
21:6: And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
21:7: And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
21:8: Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
21:9: But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.
21:10: And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,
21:11: Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:
21:12: Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
21:13: And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.
21:14: And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; 
21:15: Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.
21:16: Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. 
21:17: Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
21:18: And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
21:19: Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
21:20: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.
21:21: And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:
21:22: And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.
21:23: And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.
21:24: And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
21:25: Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
21:26: And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
22:1: Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.
22:2: And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
22:3: And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,
22:4: Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:
22:5: And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,
22:6: Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
22:7: Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
22:8: And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.  And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
22:9: And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.
22:10: And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book.  And Shaphan read it before the king. 
22:11: And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
22:12: And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying, 
22:13: Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us. 
22:14: So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.
22:15: And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,
22:16: Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read:
22:17: Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
22:18: But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;
22:19: Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.
22:20: Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.  And they brought the king word again.
23:1: And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
23:2: And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.
23:3: And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.  And all the people stood to the covenant.
23:4: And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.
23:5: And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
23:6: And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.
23:7: And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.
23:8: And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
23:9: Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren. 
23:10: And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
23:11: And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire. 
23:12: And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron. 
23:13: And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
23:14: And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
23:15: Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.
23:16: And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.
23:17: Then he said, What title is that that I see?  And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.
23:18: And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones.  So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
23:19: And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.
23:20: And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.
23:21: And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.
23:22: Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
23:23: But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.
23:24: Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
23:25: And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
23:26: Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.
23:27: And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
23:28: Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
23:29: In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
23:30: And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre.  And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
23:31: Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
23:32: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done. 
23:33: And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
23:34: And Pharaoh-nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there. 
23:35: And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-nechoh. 
23:36: Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
23:37: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
24:1: In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
24:2: And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.
24:3: Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;
24:4: And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.
24:5: Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
24:6: So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
24:7: And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
24:8: Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.  And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
24:9: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.
24:10: At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
24:11: And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it.
24:12: And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
24:13: And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.
24:14: And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
24:15: And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24:16: And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
24:17: And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah. 
24:18: Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.  And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
24:19: And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. 
24:20: For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
25:1: And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.
25:2: And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
25:3: And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
25:4: And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.
25:5: And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.
25:6: So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
25:7: And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
25:8: And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:
25:9: And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire.
25:10: And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
25:11: Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away.
25:12: But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
25:13: And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
25:14: And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. 
25:15: And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
25:16: The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight. 
25:17: The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work. 
25:18: And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
25:19: And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city:
25:20: And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:
