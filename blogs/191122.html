</table><br>	Ok, so I (queued) up a 30 min playing jam, 8/6/74 to be exact man what a jam. Anywho I cant seem to find the power or rather the inspiration or the will power to really create, at act, to achieve. Neither am I possed by some almighty flame of Cupid driving me to ravage and plunder anything what looks like a tasty snack. Ok well maybe I do wann do that but fuck man IDk I really am a fuckign weirdo and dont wanna be bringin anyone else down. In that case why not go hole up with Chris and Casey some more? As you could not bring them down half as much as you may bring them up. One's a retard and the other a maniac. Neither can be imparting you with any wisdom in the slightst. This seems to suggest that dithching them would be in my best interets. In opposition I am worried that loosing my only two (current) friends could lead to a downward spiral of my mental condition.

	I have heard it is important to speak with yourself when trapped on alone on a desert island or else you risk loosing the part of your brain which specializes in verbal communication. I wonder if written, typed, or otherwise is likewise effected. To tell you the truth, I do not know however I am sure it is learnable. I know how to aquire this knowledge. I would cunduct a search on Google and check a few different websites and try and form a consensus. Not a surefire solution as Google, or Duck Duck Go, or whoever is perfectly capable of tweaking the search results in any way they see fit however I am not so paranoid to think that is of much concern in the present topic. Politics however is absolute war of the minds. It is the most civil war possible where lines are drawn and revenges enacted. It inspires men to great heights and equally low depths. It is the least bad form of government, which is a neccesary evil. without any government we would be a rabid and wild people. With our current government we are barely able to speak to eachother without resorting to obscenities, pleasantries, or incomprehensible fear and loathing. Oh godI think im going to be sick.

	What did I eat? Those burgers. Two of them. 3-4 hours ago. If we all get sick its the end. The job gonna be drying up I can feel it. Maybe not today, prolly not this year but I can feel it and Im scared. Im scared cuz I dont know what the fuck is going on. Im scared cuz I feel like Im not gonna make it, I cant cut it, Im gonna get left behind. Im scared cuz I aint got no one watching my back or tryna catch me slippin. Im scared cuz this is the best I can do. But at least Im doing it. My wrist hurts, theres a red splotch across the top right hand corner of my LEFT HAND wrist. I still feel sick. My back hurts. My stomach hurts. Im fucking stoned on SParc fluff and it feels bad man. Im not even on the road and it feels mighty bad. Guess I'll take a walk downtown? Meh it's cold outside. Wtf I cant play minecraft cuz my wrist is hella fucked up, I cant play the guitar cuz it used to fuck my wrist up. Working in the wine bar fucked my thumb up. Damn.

IDK he's a crazy mother fucker but I dont believe he will actually attack me and if he does, hes a literal criple so for once I can fight a fair fight. Well no he weighs much more than I do. Plus he'll plan it. Yeah. Fuck.SCarlett time...IM dizy, feel sick, smell like shit. People hate me got kicked last weekend on Market/4 always screamin at cars cuz they be tryin to kill people. fuck idk
