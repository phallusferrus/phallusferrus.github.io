Okay I'm pretty drunk, and sleepy, and feeling a little sick. I drank a 'high gravity lager' called earthquake and it was honestly WORSE than a 4Loko. I should have just gotten normal piss beer, or better yet no beer at all. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
So the soundtrack to my stupidity is Miles Davis' Bitches Brew which is really fucking amazing. I put on Kind of Blue when I was working on...what the hell was I working on? Oh! The letter! and then I put on Bitches Brew cuz I wanted to write Pascal's triangle in C. I failed. I can probably figure it out in the morning. Right? I can describe the algorithm, that should be half the battle. If the first layer return [1], second [1, 1] else return
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
[1]
<br><br><br>
[1, 1]
<br><br><br>
[1, 1+1, 1], 
<br><br><br>
[1, 1+1, 1+1, 1],
<br><br><br>
[1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1, 1],
<br><br><br>
[1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1, 1]...
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
SO I need to figure out how to describe the middle of the pyramid. Or maybe it's just a mirror image of the past...like the first is a special case but then the second is a mirror of that. but then the third introduces a new term and the fourth mirrors the first two terms. the fifth introduces a new term and the 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
OK! So if it's an even term (above 2!) mirror the first (num) terms
<br><br><br>
else firstnum terms, firstnum[term] + 1, firstum terms
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Yeah I'm not in the right state of mind to be reasoning about this sort of thing, not to mention I'm still in the first damned chapter of the C book but this is where I got stuck in SICP. I like this as a hobby but it's mentally challenging and I can't even remember to bring a mask with me to Subway.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Speaking of Masks and Subway, I got a mask today! And I got Subway! I awoke in a sweat  dazed and confused around two. I quietly entered and exited the restroom, played hide and go seek with the hand sanitizer, then hoped out the window into the slightly unpleasant Washington weather (21C) I missed the bus, forgot my mask and the hand sanitizer so I  walked around Subway. When I went in the lady told me to leave, but she took my order outside and low key hooked me up. She only charged me $10.33 for two sandwiches and then I ate them down by the Columbia River.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I moseyed back up to the bus stop at 4 and the rain started to pour. A man across the street held a sign "Jay Inslee Hates You" lol Jay Inslee has no idea who I am. He left in the rain, I waited under a tree in the park for the bus. It never came. A gold corolla rolled by at 420 instead. The rain let up by 5, still no bus, so I walked back to the trailer and left a post on Craigslist seeking a ride to and from Vancouver. I need to go to the bank. This is one of my plans. There are backups.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
If I cant get a ride from Craigslist I can try to hitchhike and once in Vancouver / Portland I can buy a car or a bus ticket or try and return. With the money in my hand I will be ready to make a big move. I confirmed the banks are open regular hours, all I needed was the mask which I now have. I am torn between decisions.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I could stay here and slowly waste away. Already Chevron is out of Hot Pockets, but there's always Subway...right?
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Get a car and sneak around the suburbs. Sleeping at night again and getting food wherever I want with my wheels. But where will I charge my shit? The libraries and starbucks are all closed. Those were essential to my success as a homeless person.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Get a Greyhound bus ticket to NYC and do a fast food / quick service tour of America. One last hurrah! before the supply chains fail for good. I could get pizza in NY, hot dogs in Chicago, White Castle, Whataburger, In and OUt, Farolito etc...could be pretty comfy but the money would burn out quick and unless I made a friend or found an opportunity on the road that would be lost time that could cost me dearly.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Call Casey, Greyhound to the city find a job get a place and move on. Damn that sounds nice, is it achievable? Probably...just gotta call Casey and if he's into it then yes very achievable.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Or, of course, I could man up for real and take a tarp and a sleeping bag into the woods and learn how to live wild. If I want to survive long term without society this could be the best move. But let's be honest, I'm waaaay too much of a wimp for that. Instead I'll just starve with the rest when the food runs out. Right?
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
It's up to me and unfortunately this is a timed quiz tick tock tick tock another hour on the clock ding dong 20 mins to five, six days after the fourth of July. The crescent moon is next week, it's July, but I am not in somewhere in San Francisco and far from any back porch. You only hope for that would be Craigslist immediately and a hitchhiking journey or a call to Casey and a bit of luck to take me to the Greyhound.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Ok seriously Miles Davis is fucking incredible. Also I'm still perpetually hungry....I just want to eat. If I had my goodly thousands I could have two subs a day for....months at least. That could be another move. What could I ACTUALLY accomplish if I was here for MONTHS? Could I really get through one or both of these programming books? Only if I could really stay sober, not an easy task.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I will end up making a decision and, hopefully, live long enough to reflect on this post in a better frame of mind. I can only hope I make a good enough decision and that I stay well fed, healthy, and....yeah IDK I'm gonna need to either ditch this computer or keep it safe and charged. Not gonna be easy. No Starbucks and no library could be a deal breaker.
