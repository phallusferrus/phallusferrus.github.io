I do think it is a good idea to keep a journal, not just personally but also a financial journal. It is always a powerful tool to be able to go back and read where my thoughts were at another point in time. The notebooks that I still have in my possession are absolutely priceless. The best part is when I get to see that my problems haven't really changed dramatically for over a year now. Anyways a brief recap of my day:
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I woke up around 630 and regretfully jerked off thinking about Noelle. It was without a doubt the worst orgasm I've had in weeks. Just terrible. After that I did my laundry and had a couple of pork buns. They were hella fresh and I don't really regret the $3 I spent on them. Not as good as Clement street at all but the convenience of being able to get one while doing laundry is just about unbeatable. Hit the pen a few times while listening to that Help>Slip>Frank video from 76. Good times. I've been worried that the pen might not be very healthy. So I guess I have to switch back to flower. LMAO. I am very 
much addicted to weed. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Anyways upon returning home every one of my roommates, Ken, Henry, and Nic (And his daughter) were all in the kitchen and I just kinda slinked off to my room while he called me a "Corporate kitchen prep cook" I took a shit, saw Nic in a bathtowel and then beat it on down the line. Found a nice ground score in the Polo fields, only slightly dented blue 32oz hydro flask. I'm gonna try and wash it at work today and bring it into rotation. Had to double back home after finding it then once I was back home I ate my beef chow main from 22nd (Didn't get food poisoning. Looks like I found my Chinese place!) and chilled for a while until Chris compelled me to go down to Stern Grove. Walked down to the N-Judah rode to 19th caught the 28 and walked in from Safeway on Taraval.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Chris was being weird all day. It might have been me but it felt a lot like his communication skills were completely destroyed. He wanted water but made me feel like an asshole for buying it for him. Spring water? Really? Also he called me while I was walking at Vicente and 18 demanding I come meet him immediately. Why? IDK maybe it was me. Well they had the front corner of Stern Grove fenced off with the park cop there so I walked around with the sea of people to the western entrance. No security, no donation people and hella good looking women. Walking in I smiled at a cute asian girl with bleached blonde hair and red earrings. She was sitting all alone by the entrance and I could almost imagine we made eye contact. I made it all the way to the top of the forest chill hill before I made contact with Chris. He was with Rob who had secured a nice chill spot down by the pissers. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I made my way clumsily down the face of the chill hill (hopefully to the chagrin of Chris and Co) only to find a small group of young people sitting around Chris on the Blankey-Scarf. There was Chris and Rob, Rob's girlfriend who looked like a whiter Alexis from Toni's also two of her friends. Both cute, and Lo and Behold one was the cute asian girl from before. Seriously small city. Anyways I pretended I didnt care about her but she definitely said something to her friend and I'd bet it was about me. I delivered Chris' gallon of water and rolled up a nice Fatty Kalen joint. I rolled it extra big cuz I wanted to impress the cute girl. Right as I was finishing up and handing the behemoth off to Chris to insert the crutch the other girl's (Who is named after Champagne?) dad showed up which was, weird, I guess but IDk SF am I right. He didn't seem to care so me Rob and Chris went ahead and proceeded to smoke the entire Fatty by ourselves. I don't think any of the girls hit it or if they did only briefly. Keep in mind I was trying very hard to not say anything to them IDK why only things I remember was telling them where Humboldt was and how the Redwood trees in Stern Grove were sad. Chris went ahead and told them he writes the "Premier ASMR blog in the world" and then (From my point of view) got interrogated to pieces by the Champagne girl. These kids go to college. The world (SF!) is not as ignorant as Chris might hope. Anyways that was the killing moment of the vibes for me and as soonas the band kicked into "Big Poppa" I knew I had to leave.

Got right up and walked to the forest chill hill, got sardined in the paths, stepped on some people, was treated like a decent human being by this one guy who stopped the flow so I could pass. Unnecessary but appreciated. And by the time I had completed a loop I decided enough was enough and set out back towards 19th AVE. The 28 was packed with a dozen people waiting at Wawona AND Sloat. So I gave up on that idea and walked over to Junipero Sera. Arrived right after the K pulled out so I got on the M for the first time. Weird vibes, lots of families. Rode it down to Stonestown where I transferred to the 29 to Far Farolito where I had 4 tacos 2 beef and 2 carnitas for $15 (YA SF) before getting back on the 29 going to Grocery Outlet on Geary and eating 3 double pack crunchy granola bars on my walk back to the house. Now I'm here and I'm off to bed.
