	Okay so I put on 8/27/72 PITB and decided that was a good amount of time to allocate for my new endeavor to keep some kind of a journal. So far I have been doing ok but I am still dissapointed with the speed of my recording. If i am to be able to use this exercise to gain anything of value I need to be able to complete it as fast as possible as the act of typing it has an actual and very real effect on my current perception of life, the universe, and everything.

So ya this song has always been pretty heavy for me since I wrecked my truck right there haha "let him cast a stone at me" and she sure did. Strange to think that's over a year ago. My how time flies and I am sure in a better mind and space set as of this writing than at that (now lost) review of my sad times. I am glad to have had them though. Without the lessons and knowledge that I gained I would no be who I am today. That includes the guy who got out of bed at 5 am only to find the bathroom door locked and thus proceeded to piss in the park. Lol well it was somewhat nostalgic for me as that was the exact place I used to piss when I would park out near 36th ave on Fulton. No joke between 37 and 40 I used to refer to as "the promised land" as when I discovered their street sweeping days are on a Friday as opposed to the other Wed. and Thur. slots I was amazed and exclaimed "I can stay on Fulton 24/7 now!" so unaware that in only a few weeks (or days) time I would be renting out a full room right here on 36th ave. It is expensive but am happy. The fog is near omnipresent and its an easy bike ride to and from work (minus that SoMa shit)

	In python I am somewhat stuck on a game of Tic-Tac-Toe I am wanting to create. I am frustrated primarily because this is a problem which I have already solved in python about 14 months ago but lost the code and now am struggling to reproduce it. I think if I were to re-write the current code from the ground up or whatever so to speak I would be successful but that sounds like so much work. Fuck. I must hate work. If I hate work then I wont be able to survive? Not really. Most everyone hates work hell I bet Bobby even hates work and that it hurts when everyone makes fun of him on the subreddit. Then again he's rich. Maybe I just gotta stay focused on the money and let what comes come.

	I  already made it out on the streets of Venice Beach and now San Francisco for over a year what else is left? I have operated in places with no connection with high society and the absolute definition of "City of the one percent" Why is it that a city as rich and opulent as our fair San Francisco should become such a bastion of liberal values. I believe it is simply a reflection of our openness to welcome all and make space for any who choose to make space here. We are a blank slate, the greatest canvas of the west where weirdo's from all walks of life come together to paint the walls and erect the canyons of our reality with Plaster, Concrete, Acrylic and Shit.

	Love is gone and all is left now is everything in the entire universe. Without bounds is the expanse of information available to me in the single click of a button. A quick google search will expose with ease every written syllable of Cicero, Chaucer, J
