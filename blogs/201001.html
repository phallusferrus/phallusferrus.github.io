New website who dis? Seriosly though my paranoia has taken a turn for the
<br><br><br>
worse when I've decided that a github address I had advertised on my Instagram
<br><br><br>
for 24 hours was a matter of corporal security.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
It's been a terrible tortue, cushioned only by the false pillows of alcohol,
<br><br><br>
marijuana, coffee, and LCD screens. I have not slept for a while, I couldnt
<br><br><br>
sleep last night and I drank a Monster espresso drink for breakfast aound 10
<br><br><br>
AM. 300 mg of caffeine is really now joke. In a perfect world I would be
<br><br><br>
waking up in around 30 minutes to an hour in order to prepare for my day. The
<br><br><br>
first day of October and my life is as disgusting as it was in May. Worse even
<br><br><br>
as the filth has been allowed to multiply in the long weeks, months, of my
<br><br><br>
repugnant isolation. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I managed to read for a week straight but it was affecting my eyes. Staring at
<br><br><br>
the laptop for 16 hours a day is not good and I realized that I haven't slept
<br><br><br>
in a good, true, and proper darkness for months. I'm not living for anything
<br><br><br>
and the world around me continues to collapse. The only thing which really
<br><br><br>
felt stable in the entire last week was Tripcode's phone rant which came out
<br><br><br>
around 16 hours ago. After the debate I hold little hope for our sad people.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
The first (and possibly Final) presidential debate between Trump and Biden was
<br><br><br>
last night. Each candidate began with two minutes uninterrupted to say
<br><br><br>
something. Trump went first, Biden remembered to say thank you. Within 60
<br><br><br>
seconds of 'the gloves coming off' so to speak the debate descended into
<br><br><br>
nearly unintelligable chaos. Some points which stand out in my mind are
<br><br><br>
Biden's laugh, Trump asking for Biden's Supreme court picks or his stance on
<br><br><br>
packing the court (his response was: Whatever I decide when the time comes is
<br><br><br>
what I believe) Biden's rejection of the Green New Deal, Trump's "$3.5 million
<br><br><br>
to Biden's son" claim.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 The coronavirus exchange seemed pointless, both parties
<br><br><br>
fucked up and have turned the whole thing into a political battleground. Trump
<br><br><br>
didn't act swiftly enough (which would have been shutting down all roads,
<br><br><br>
bridges, airports, cities ETC on Feb 2nd during the SuperBowl) HOWEVER the
<br><br><br>
democrats not only mocked him for his 'xenophobic' travel ban Nancy Pelosi
<br><br><br>
herself (and London Breed if I'm not mistaken) were urging people to visit
<br><br><br>
China town as late as Feb 24th and the city (and NY I believe) held a Chinese
<br><br><br>
New Year Parade. Blame lies on both sides, both sides had massive gatherings
<br><br><br>
over the summer, and I am starting to believe the virus may have mutated into
<br><br><br>
a less deadly disease. I may not be right about that, I'm not sure.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
After Coronavirus they talked about race I believe where Trump refused to
<br><br><br>
condemn white supremacy again. He's so fucking stupid, both of them are, but
<br><br><br>
Trump's job is so easy. Just repeat after me, "White supremacy is a terrible
<br><br><br>
thing. Black supremacy is also a terrible thing. In my America every man woman
<br><br><br>
and child is treated fairly and equally" or something like that. Instead he
<br><br><br>
came out about "both sides" (which is obviously true as well. People have been
<br><br><br>
assholes on both sides since the start) and screamed "Law and Order" which
<br><br><br>
gave Biden the easy "Equal Law and Order for all Americans" soundbite.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Finally they discussed the results of the election and I became horrified by
<br><br><br>
what I heard. At this point it seems to me that both sides are preparing to
<br><br><br>
declare victory and...I have no idea what will happen next. Could be a civil
<br><br><br>
war like for real. I don't want to fight, no black eyes, or nothing. No one
<br><br><br>
want's to die, but a lot of people are feeling hopeless, restless, useless,
<br><br><br>
and conditions like these are a breeding ground for social unrest. I read
<br><br><br>
Pelosi is working on another stimulus with Mnuchin. Could happen. $1200 paper
<br><br><br>
dollars. yay. That will keep the bread on the table through winter, hopefully.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
A few other things I noticed was anytime Trump tried to nail Biden on an issue
<br><br><br>
the Moderator would shut him down. Biden never gave a concrete answer to any
<br><br><br>
of the major accusations but I think that's normal for politicians. Trump
<br><br><br>
absolutely did not respect the time limits but to his credit Biden was
<br><br><br>
interrupting him as well. I think the debates would be better with timers on
<br><br><br>
the screen so everyone can see how much time they're using and then have a
<br><br><br>
fucking buzzer or the lights change or something go off to shut them the fuck
<br><br><br>
up. No more rambling past 2 mins it should be 20 mins flat and then BUZZZ next
<br><br><br>
contestant. That or give them each like 10 mins at a time to make a point then
<br><br><br>
spend the rest just yelling at each other with no moderator and one mic in the
<br><br><br>
center of the room or something. IDK, the format was no good. I wathced some
<br><br><br>
clips from old debates, regan, and carter. They were calmly discussing policy
<br><br><br>
points and were honestly boring.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Finally the SPICY finds
<br><br><br>
Biden had some kind of insane metal gadget up his sleeve. Never seen something
<br><br><br>
like this before. You can clearly see it if you slow the video down at 57:15
<br><br><br>
on the CSPAN stream of the debate. Trump's mic made him sound SUPER sick in
<br><br><br>
the first few mins of the debate, and Trump has small hands (like my
<br><br><br>
size...SAD)
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I wrote this in the dwm arch box I got set up with Luke's st and modestly
<br><br><br>
customized dwm config.h but it's fairly minimal. I'm going to try and adapt to
<br><br><br>
this kind of an environment because now that I know how to set it up (and I
<br><br><br>
have the backups on this github to prove it!) I can in theory set this up
<br><br><br>
again and again on any machine I get the linux kernal to boot on (and has
<br><br><br>
enough ram to run startx ~200MBs)
<br><br><br>
