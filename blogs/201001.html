New website who dis? Seriously though my paranoia has taken a turn for the
worse when I've decided that a github address I had advertised on my Instagram
for 24 hours was a matter of corporal security.

<br><br><br>
It's been a terrible torture, cushioned only by the false pillows of alcohol,
marijuana, coffee, and LCD screens. I have not slept for a while, I couldn't
sleep last night and I drank a Monster espresso drink for breakfast around 10
AM. 300 mg of caffeine is really no joke! In a perfect world I would be
waking up in around 30 minutes to an hour in order to prepare for my day. The
first day of October and my life is as disgusting as it was in May. Worse even
as the filth has been allowed to multiply in the long weeks, months, of my
repugnant isolation. 

<br><br><br>
I managed to read for a week straight but it was affecting my eyes. Staring at
<br><br><br>
the laptop for 16 hours a day is not good and I realized that I haven't slept
<br><br><br>
in a good, true, and proper darkness for months. I'm not living for anything
<br><br><br>
and the world around me continues to collapse. The only thing which really
<br><br><br>
felt stable in the entire last week was Tripcode's phone rant which came out
<br><br><br>
around 16 hours ago. After the debate I hold little hope for our sad people.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
The first (and possibly Final) presidential debate between Trump and Biden was
<br><br><br>
last night. Each candidate began with two minutes uninterrupted to say
<br><br><br>
something. Trump went first, Biden remembered to say "thank you." Within 60
<br><br><br>
seconds of 'the gloves coming off' so to speak the debate descended into
<br><br><br>
nearly unintelligible chaos. Some points which stand out in my mind are
<br><br><br>
Biden's laugh, Trump asking for Biden's Supreme Court picks or his stance on
<br><br><br>
packing The Court (his response was: Whatever I decide when the time comes is
<br><br><br>
what I believe) Biden's rejection of the Green New Deal, and Trump's "$3.5 million
<br><br><br>
to Biden's son" claim.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 The coronavirus exchange seemed pointless, both parties
<br><br><br>
fucked up and have turned the whole thing into a political battleground. Trump
<br><br><br>
didn't act swiftly enough (which would have been shutting down all roads,
<br><br><br>
bridges, airports, cities et cetera on Feb 2nd during the SuperBowl) HOWEVER the
<br><br><br>
democrats not only mocked him for his 'xenophobic' travel ban, Nancy Pelosi
<br><br><br>
herself (and London Breed if I'm not mistaken) were urging people to visit
<br><br><br>
China town as late as Feb 24th and the city (and NY I believe) held a Chinese
<br><br><br>
New Year Parade. Blame liars and fools on both sides, both sides had massive gatherings
<br><br><br>
over the summer, (and I am starting to believe the virus may have mutated into
<br><br><br>
a less deadly disease as I feel there have not been a proportional amount of death to
<br><br><br>
the size of the gatherings I saw..) and nobody has had a serious idea of what to do.
<br><br><br>
I think it's disingenuous for either of them to claim they knew what to do. Another
<br><br><br>
interesting point is the politicization of a vaccine. Trump could try and rush one
<br><br><br>
out before the election. I personally wouldn't want to take one, at least not the first round.
<br><br><br>
if my life depends on it sure, but I'm still under the impression a coronavirus has
<br><br><br>
no vaccine. I hope to be proven wrong. A good vaccine would be badass.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
After Coronavirus they talked about race where Trump refused to condemn
<br><br><br>
white supremacy again. He's so fucking stupid, or racist,  all he has to do is
<br><br><br>
fucking repeat after me, "Racism is the ugliest human behavior. White supremacy is a
<br><br><br>
terrible thing. Black supremacy is also a terrible thing. In my America every man woman
<br><br><br>
and child is treated fairly and equally" or something like that. Instead he
<br><br><br>
came out about "radical ANTIFA" (which is obviously true as well. People have been
<br><br><br>
assholes on both sides since the start) and screamed "Law and Order" which
<br><br><br>
gave Biden the easy "Equal Law and Order for all Americans" soundbite.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
At last they discussed the results of the election and I became horrified by
<br><br><br>
what I heard. At this point it seems to me that both sides are preparing to
<br><br><br>
declare victory next month and I have no idea what will happen next. Could be a civil
<br><br><br>
war like for real. I don't want to fight, no black eyes, or nothing. No one
<br><br><br>
want's to die, but a lot of people are feeling hopeless, restless, useless,
<br><br><br>
and conditions like these are a breeding ground for social unrest. I read
<br><br><br>
Pelosi is working on another stimulus with Mnuchin. Could happen. $1200 paper
<br><br><br>
dollars. yay. That will keep the bread on the table through winter, hopefully.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
A few other things I noticed was anytime Trump tried to nail Biden on an issue
<br><br><br>
the Moderator would shut him down. Biden never gave a concrete answer to any
<br><br><br>
of the major accusations but I think that's normal for politicians. Trump
<br><br><br>
absolutely did not respect the time limits but to his credit Biden was
<br><br><br>
interrupting him as well. I think the debates would be better with timers on
<br><br><br>
the screen so everyone can see how much time they're using and then have a
<br><br><br>
fucking buzzer or the lights change or something  to shut them the fuck
<br><br><br>
up. No more rambling past 2 mins it should be 120 secs flat and then BUZZZ next
<br><br><br>
contestant. That or give them each like 10 mins at a time to make a point then
<br><br><br>
spend an hour just yelling at each other with no moderator and one mic in the
<br><br><br>
center of the room or something. IDK, the debate was no good. I watched some
<br><br><br>
clips from old debates, Reagan, and Carter. They were calmly discussing policy
<br><br><br>
points and were honestly boring.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Finally the SPICY finds,
<br><br><br>
Biden had some kind of insane metal gadget up his sleeve. Never seen something
<br><br><br>
like this before. You can clearly see it attached to his left wrist at 57:15
<br><br><br>
on the CSPAN stream of the debate. Trump's mic made him sound SUPER sick in
<br><br><br>
the first few mins of the debate, and Trump has small hands (like my
<br><br><br>
size...SAD) also what does Trump mean by "charge Gen. Flynn with the Logan act?" I
<br><br><br>
suspect he will try to push his claim about Obama spying on his campaign in 2016.
<br><br><br>
which is a serious claim but I'm not sure he'll be able to convince anyone to believe it.
<br><br><br>


<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I wrote this in the dwm arch box I got set up with Luke's st and modestly
<br><br><br>
customized dwm config.h but it's fairly minimal. I'm going to try and adapt to
<br><br><br>
this kind of an environment because now that I know how to set it up (and I
<br><br><br>
have the backups on this github to prove it!) I can in theory set this up
<br><br><br>
again and again on any machine I get the Linux Kernel to boot on (and has
<br><br><br>
enough ram to run startx <200M)
