	It is obviously become important to keep some sort of journal, or diary, or log. The ability to go back and see exactly what trip I was on at some specific time is very powerful data. For example yesterday I was at Best Buy with Chris. I didn't go in, I waited with my bike (orange fixie) by the bike rack creating a chart of the dates on which I withdrew money from my bank account(while some suits vaped to my right...) formulating a table which showed how long my money has lasted my throughout my time here at 876. What I found was that $500 will usually last me 3.5 weeks on average (mode) but that between May 20 and June 27 $500 lasted me 5 weeks. Wondering why I came home to search through my "thoughts" log and was dismayed to find it very sparse. Who would have thought that creating a log actually takes some amount of work. If I want this it will take up some amount of time but if I am careful it will not become overwhelming or too time consuming.

	Today I woke up tired at 4:04 AM and didn't poop at home. Probably because I did not eat enough yesterday to warrant a full shit this morning. It was two twin crunchy granola bars and a Safeway sushi. Out the door at 5 and listened to the third set of 2-22-74. I did not smoke at all before work and Eyes started up right about the time I hit market street. China doll rolled in as I turned onto Brannon off 5. First 3 hours I was very lovy dovy with Wendy then she mentioned to Gabby she lives with a Chico. I was very hurt and then acted like a bitch the rest of the day to her. Nothin much tween 9 and 11 just like organized dry storage and...clean drains. For lunch we had rice, beans, cauliflower, beef, and swordfish. It was bomb but left a bad taste in my mouth. Quick google search shows that yes, they have the highest mercury of any fish...worse than tuna lmao.

	After work I went to shit at the Salesforce Park. Nice. Smoked with Chris in the Jack Kerouac alley. Some dude came out and killed it on the guitar. Fun. Our conversation was really two different conversations. I think that maybe we are both crazy and just like to have someone else to talk to that isn't our selves...or Casey. So ya. Rode my bike back sans speaker and ran into Henry in the hallway. Talked to him for like 60 secs and he offered me a beer. I talked a lot. And fast. Came into my room and translated 11-9-73 from SHN to FLAC in about 9 mins. IDK if that's better than it even was before but somehow it is less of a headache. LMAO I'm hella hungry and gonna go eat pho sounds nice but I'll be late. Ill survive?

	More spiritually I think this is hell and everyone here is here to suffer. Maybe. Or I'm in paradise. One of the two. LMAO life is like that

	Just got back from My Cahn. Ate the big pho. Paid $12. Dude was kinda an asshole but could just be cuz I looked high as hell. Riding downtown I read spanish and latin Wikipedia about the Argo and Orators. Didn't really learn that much but I think the practice is important. WOW i had 11-9-73 on repeat and Half-Step just came BACK on. That's the song I started the album on when I first converted it and began this whole thing about 3 hours ago... Crazy.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	So on the bus ride there was this beautiful woman I wrote a poem about her I call "Diana" its not really all that good but just like the reading of latin and spanish I think it's important to practice with the intention of improving. Pho filled me up walked down Grant to Market and caught another 5 Fulton rode and listened to a lot of dumb white girl nonsense.

	These people take out loans to go to "school" where they don't learn how to make money AND waste more money trying to impress friends and win allies. Some I imagine must make some good money. I suppose my aversion to higher education will be show to be a good or bad choice in time. Only time can tell. As far as making money goes I have basically given up on entrepreneurship mostly cuz of how my co-workers made fun of me which is stupid. These people are twice my age and still working the same job that I have now with no skills and even less education. Maybe if I can fall in love with programming I can get a nice cushy gig eating the Pinterest food but not having to pretend to clean the dry storage for an hour and a half.

	Maybe what I have going on right now is even better and preferred to what they techno-hombres do upstairs. I am sure they make more money. Eventually I will need more money possibly as soon as March when my lease is up. 8 months. Or less. Every day a little bit less. A little bit closer. Goals for the weekend is to stay productive, save money, and watch my mota intake. Next weekend is Labor Day I hope to ride my bike up to Mt. Davidson and listen to the Beatles. I love holidays mostly cuz they're hella boring and I have to occupy and feed myself an extra day. OK Half-Step is over and I'm out. TO BED!!!
