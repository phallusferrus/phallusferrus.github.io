By far my favorite notepad...now ive only used mousepad for the last two years or so tho to be fair so I really dont have much else to compare it to. But. The setup I've got is really good. It works. Also Jerry's killin the Jimmy solo.

	 For a while there I was really contemplating a name change to James 'Jimmy" or "Jim" for short. I used Jim in a resturant yesterday and it felt really off. So thats a no. Would have used Ryan but the guy before me used it. I actually hear "ryan" all the damn time in resturants like not every time they need to call my name but it's a super common name for sure at least around here. I really miss SF now. I miss it a lot to be honest. Hope to be back soon. SO scared still but I realized im letting my fears run my life. Threw away the best job I've ever had just cuz I was afraid to get back. Im full of shame. Lied to my boss. Fuck it sucks. Im gonna have to hustle hella hard when I get back.
<br><br><br>
	 Fuck.
<br><br><br>

	The second solo is always the best. Damn. Broken heart never feels so bad. You know how it goes. Great song, Im not sure why it doesnt get as many accolades as it should . The desk is too high here for the chair. FAILURE

	It's looking like its time to roll away the dew. IF all has gone well I just wrote a short python script that can update an html page with new links to these stories...however! They link to us as if we were html pages. We need another layer of abstraction to copy the text contained here into the proper spaces of a pre-fabricated html scaffolding.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	So here I go trying to make an auto blogger which will be inferior to what  I already used to have on python anywhere AND to whatever chirs got from watching youtube or whatever. So on one hand it's a waste of my time but on the other hand I really am learning a good amount about how this stuff works and that will probably serve me better in the long term than just watching and following a youtube video to start a wordpress site...But only time will tell.
