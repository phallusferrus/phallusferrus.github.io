Good Morning! Even though it feels more like a 'good evening' to me.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Today is Thurday May the 7th a bright sunny day peeks through the cheap plastic window shades and Jerry's singing about being tangled up in blue throug my headphones. It's the 43rd anniversary of 5/7/77 which has one of my favorie Terrapin Stations and also Billy's birthday (Happy birthday Bill! Hope you're well in quarantine right now and THANK YOU for a real good time) Truth be told I really didn't appreciate Bill's drummnin as much as I should until New Years Eve. I was hangin out right behind the rhythm devils and watching his drumming, especially during Eyes, fuck I was brought to tears it was the closest to Jerry i'll ever get, or at least as close as I have gotten so far. But I digress that's really a story for another blog.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I have been in quarantine for 70 days. I have left his house once since February and leave this room only to take a shit or shower twice a week (which I'm considering cutting back to once a week) All in all things could be better, things could be worse. The internet works and I still have a few weeks of canned food left. If I had a convinient way to cook my 50lbs of Rice and Beans I would have food for months but alas I overlooked that in my haste to prepare. I always forget ~something~ it might as well be a rule at this point.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Isolation life has treated me better than I'm sure it has many others. This is not my first time being alone for months at a time, in fact I think this is the third time I've gone over a month without speaking to anyone else (though this is by far the longest) and with my practice comes an ability to keep content (and hopefully sane) while living alone. I keep Jerry one 24/7 (turned down while I sleep) and only pause the music to watch a youtube video, or listen to something else. Pink Floyd gave me their Pompeii video a few weeks back, thanks Pink Floyd. Been listening to more Led Zeppelin this past week than I have in years. I forget sometimes to listen to music other than Jerry. Theres a lot of good music out there (Beatles, Santana, Guns n Roses, Hot Tuna/Jefferson Airplane, White Stripes, Sublime, Jimi Hendrix, just off the top of my head) but nothing can be better than Jerry.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I have been learning a lot about how to use my computer and already I have created an auto-blogger pythong script. All I have to do is type up a .txt file, run a simple command, follow my wizard, and viola the script will convert txt>html, update my bloglist and push the changes to git (assuming I have an internet connection) Im proud of it even though I am fully cognizant that it offers LESS functionality than the old blog I used to run on pythanywhere. It's essentially a duct taped piece of shit but it's MY duct taped piece of shit.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
My current project is building a simple Javascript game "Day at School" which follows a looser through his day at school. It plays like a choose your own adventure story book and is built like a duct taped piece of shit, but it's built and so far it works. Is it fun? Meh, its at least funny at times but its barely a game. Maybe I'll finish it, maybe ill move on to something else. I want to finish it but im not even half way done so we'll see.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
My new favorite youtubers are Luke Smith and DistroTube they have shown me better ways to customize and get comfy in the linux environment and as a result I can use youtube-dl, vim, and a tiling window manager. It makes me feel cool and I THINK it does make me more productive but it could be a placebo. I have also started visiting 4chan. I had grown tired of being banned from so many sub-reddits and that whenever I post something inflamattory redditors would stock through my post history to attack me wherever I went. Is reddit unusable? No, not at all in fact I still check up on my favorite subs but I spend more of my 'scroll time' on 4chan now instead.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
4chan gets a bad rap, and it deserves it. Immediatly people started calling me racial slurs, posting graphic porn, and telling me to kill myself. BUT it's the freedom to say all that shit which provides the allure of the website to me at this moment. It's fast pased and feels like the wild west compared to Reddit. I think Reddit is more useful as an info bank where you can source knowledge (best pizza sf reddit) rather than a forum for open discussion. There is a place in my world for both.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I've always been a bit of a pessimist and the COVID situation outlook is no different. I hate to be so smug about this but I saw it coming all the way back in January and left the city. I saw a rush on grocery stores and bought plenty of food water, medicine, and toilet paper half way through February and I knew Americans couldnt stay quarantined long enough to actually defeat this thing (as of this week I believe states such as Texas and Georgia are fully open and back to buisiness though I am not sure because I honestly stopped paying much attention, been more focused on my website) but I have come to another, bleak, conclusion: This is the end of society as we know it. The virus is unlike anything we humans have dealt with before and I truly believe it was created in the Wuhan lab (not as a bioweapon obviously!) I am worried about many things A) Why do some healthy people die while some extremely old people live? B) Why are our tests so innacurate? C) Does infection give a temporary or long-term immunity? D) Is it possible the virus stays dormant in your body like Herpes or HIV? Many more things as well but its more of a vibe than a scientific process (which I trust but for the record Elon Musk also advised me "Dont doubt your vibe, it knows it's true")
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I am of the opinion that re-opening will only kill more and more people and that the damage done to the economy already is irreversable. I foresee mass poverty, food shortages, violence, death, possibly even war (civil or against China or both) My old job required hundreds of people crowded together each afternoon for lunch. Yeah thats over. So many small buisiness are dead in the water, only to be replaced by the mega-marts of our reality. So many previously free, or at least tangentially free men and women have been reduced to slaves of the system by the virus. I worry that forging your own path, opening a buisiness, or selling grilled cheese in a parking lot will never return and vanishing with it some of my favorite ways of life.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I hope to be proven wrong. I hope to go to a dead show next year, and Dolores Park on pride weekend, and Outside Lands, and everything else I had been planning before January. I hope to work again, I miss my job, I miss having a routine even if I know it's unhealthy for me. But what is health? I'm certainly not healthy today, I'm shitting green sleeping 10am-5pm and havnt walked more than a quarter mile in 2 months (other than that one time but again that will come in another blog post)
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Most of all I hope for a return to normal. We never appreciate what we have until it's gone. I miss my old life so much. I miss the fresh smell of the ocean at 5 am in San Francisco. I miss riding downtown on my fixie blasting Jerry and ripping the pot pipe. I miss eating fat meals, and lifting meat 8 hours a day at work. I miss joking around with my friends and getting stoned in the middle of Market Street. I miss Casey, and Chris. I'll never say it to him but Chris's theft of Casey's money was the spark that destroyed the world. I found out on Jan 14th spent that entire week setting up my watchtower defense program and by the time it was completed COVID was staring me down the barrel. Who shook the boat first though? I truly did not like spending time with him and ditched him on Christmas for fucks sake. Truth be told those first two weeks of January when I was ignoring Casey and Chris was plotting his crime was the best time of my life bar none. I was free, I was (relatively) rich, I was happy. I wasnt smoking any weed, I had a great job and didnt have to deal with "Fuck ok lets go get stoned and listen to you whine about money meanwhile Im burning daylight, cant get my sandwich, and gotta ride home during rush hour" FUCK I just remembered I was cooking those weeks too! Ramen and poverty burritos....Damn

Im getting sleepy and rambly but I feel good about typing this, I'll upload it and if everything goes well it will remain archived until the end of time (or atleast the next coronal mass ejection)
