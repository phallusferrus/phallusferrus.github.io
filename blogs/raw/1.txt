	Row Jimmy Row. Thats the motto and here I go, slow motion row by the three mountains. It's alright I guess. Mousepad is super great though. By far my favorite notepad...now ive only used mousepad for the last two years or so tho to be fair so I really dont have much else to compare it to. But. The setup I've got is really good. It works. Also Jerry's killin the Jimmy solo.
	 For a while there I was really contemplating a name change to James 'Jimmy" or "Jim" for short. I used Jim in a resturant yesterday and it felt really off. So thats a no. Would have used Ryan but the guy before me used it. I actually hear "ryan" all the damn time in resturants like not every time they need to call my name but it's a super common name for sure at least around here. I really miss SF now. I miss it a lot to be honest. Hope to be back soon. SO scared still but I realized im letting my fears run my life. Threw away the best job I've ever had just cuz I was afraid to get back. Im full of shame. Lied to my boss. Fuck it sucks. Im gonna have to hustle hella hard when I get back.
	 Fuck.
