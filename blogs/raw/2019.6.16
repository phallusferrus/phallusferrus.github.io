I feel like shit!
	I really do. Cant quite explain why but every day it seems worse and
worse. Like  I cant catch a brea. Chris is Fucking Nuts! and it would be in
my best interest to stay away from that psycho as much as possible. Sadly,
this will mean not chilling with Casey as well. It's gonna be rough on all
of us but he might take it the worst. Either way thats life and if they need
to rely on someone else to make it, thats their problem. I am confident I 
can do it all on my own and not need to hide out with my buddies to survive.
The life of a hermit is obtainable AND realistic. 

I will need to remember these simple principles:
	I. My job is very easy! Just keep it.
       II. Just pretend to be happy all the time. People like it.
      III. Dont worry about women, it only leads to trouble.
       IV. Cannabis is a draw on money, but also keeps me happy.
	V. Sleep dummy
