Early 80's DEAD!

Heres just my 11 favorite shows from between 81 and 85. 

Note that I clearly have a preference for 85 that year is really magic to me.

I have tried my best to select the best sounding source available but all these shows have multiple sources so feel free to poke around the archives

-----xxxxx-----

10/19/81 -  The dead went to barcelona and blew the roof off the joint! 2nd set is a perfect example of early 80's power dead featuring a Spanish Jam AND Dont ease me in as encore. How many times has that happend??

12/31/81 - Best NYE of the 80's in my opinion (well or 87 cuz this one doesnt have throwing stones and how can any show be the "Best of the 80's" without it? Joan Baez opened, the play dark star and Jerry closes with ITs all over now Baby blue. Epic

4/19/82 - Everyone talks about the raven space but the Estimated Prophet is out of this world. Bobby brings everyong back to the "California" jam somehow. Jaw dropping.

10/10/82 - I put this one on the top of my OG comment for a reason. Its just exactly perfect. Playin>CrazyFingers>SailorSaint>Touch. This show actually has outstanding versions of both touch and Throwin stones in their embryonic forms and of course they arnt as polished (or good tbh) as after Jerry's coma that does not at all take away from the magnificence of this performance. Enjoy

4/23/83 - Ill be honest, 83 is likely their weakest year until 93 but this show fucking smokes. It was Dick's pick like 6 or something thats how hot it is. Heres an unbelievable AUD

4/7/84 - I remember when I first got this show I left it on repeat on my home pc for like a week straight and would just get home and put on my headphones and be right there. Thats how good it is, only show I wanted to hear for a week+ in the 21st century. Spanish Jam will speak for itslef.

7/13/84 - Friday the 13th in Berkely AND a comet went overhead. The greek is an open air theatre and it was all visible over Jerry and the boys. The stars were literally aligned for this amazing night with Scarlett>Touch>Fire and a Dark Star Jam that not only doesnt dissapoints, it has the first spaceman jam since like idk 1969 or something. Amazing

12/28/84 - After NYE 83 I wouldnt have blamed the boys for never wanting to do another New years run. However this show proves they were out to steal heads and make up for an atrocious last year. Right out the gate Jerry sounds great on Touch and then he WAHS THE FUCK OUT on Greatest Story like seriouly goes at that fucking pedal like its 72 again then an amazing Dire wolf sold me on first sight. Brent does some weird long song Im not familiar with. Day Tripper encore isnt as good as it could have been but this shows sweet as honey

6/14/85 - Bands 20th anniversery show First set opens with a rare, weird Dancin and just gets better. The 2nd set is like something from a dream. Ledgned goes some guy yelled out "Walk me out Jerry" and the rest is history PLayin>China Doll? Comes a Time!! the only detractor is Day Job encore but hey we only have like a few dozen of those form all time so take em while we got em. Hell of a show always on my phone if just for the Stagger Lee and 2nd set

7/13/85 - A fire burned behind the band and they played FOTM in the first set. Unbelieveably cool. Duprees and Cryptical as well. Hell everything about this show just screams "Perfect" Possibly my favorite show from one of their best years

11/1/85 - This show has a crazy Sailor>DrumsSpace>Saint which isnt quite as intense as the impecable 10/10/82 it comes real close plus I love whenever DrumsSpace is used as a vehicle instead of a piss break

BONUS:

9/12/85 - Cant find the source I just got from Charlie Miller but heres a youtube video. Love any show with Greatest story and Row Jimmy makes me cry just near every time. 2nd set is flawless Franklins is so fast and bouncy TOO comes out so gently from the beamspace its almost surprising and the best part is the end of the 2nd set the crowd is just goind nuts on the NFA Chant and Jerry comes back out and they go BACK INTO NFA from the chant before an amazing Brokedown palace.

I get my shows from a website www.shnflac.net they call themselves "Lossless Legs" they host torrents of GD and related music. If this sounds like something you might be into go introduce yourself a man named Goother will set you up with an account and you too can hear this increadible Charlie MIller AUD just released like 2 days ago of this show. Its so fresh out the oven its not even on the archive yet thats why I linked to a youtube video lol

Best of Luck and Happy new year from Ryan here in San Francisco !
