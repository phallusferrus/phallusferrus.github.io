Jusus fuck:
	Shit on the shingle, Christ on the pringle
It's been two months since I typed one of these? What the fuck have
I been doing. Shit really is starting to worry me thats 60 days 


(1/20***

*Yes...I am this stoned. DUDE THIS HAS TO STOP! GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER*


1/6 ***of
the year) That I just did nothing for. Pride was fun but since then it's 
just been pinche chamba and getting stoned doing nothing with Chris. OK I
was wrong just found a writing from 7/19 NOT QUITE a month ago... Also that
was the last time I did a LICK of webdevelopment. I dont think I enjoy doing
that but I also sure as fuck dont love la chamba and I do that every day. 
Honestly it isnt so bad the only problem is I just dont know how to get along 
with other people. I always end up being weird, or mean. I think the main
allure of computer work is being able to stay away from everyone else and just
shut myself up all alone. Also the money is rather alluring as well. So ya
I guess the only way I'll ever drag myself up out of this pit of dispair is
to make a whole lotta money and ba all about that. Fuck. Well two options:

			I. CODE		II. DIE
			II. DIE


			WHADDYA THINK?
