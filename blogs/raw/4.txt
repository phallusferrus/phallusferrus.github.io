So here I go trying to make an auto blogger which will be inferior to what  I already used to have on python anywhere AND to whatever chirs got from watching youtube or whatever. So on one hand it's a waste of my time but on the other hand I really am learning a good amount about how this stuff works and that will probably serve me better in the long term than just watching and following a youtube video to start a wordpress site...But only time will tell.
