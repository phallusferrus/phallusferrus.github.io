It is nearly 4 in the morning, my mouth is full of toothpaste spit, and I've been coughing up black nasties for the last hour. The smoke is so thick that I could not see the river and could only barely make out the train at sunset. 

My reason for this short and impromptu post is a simple word, phosphine. I am predicting Life on Venus discovery on Monday Sep 14th but we will have to wait and see. I got this information from Reddit and 4chan so not exactly traditionally reputable sources but they were right about the Pandemic so this is my eternal timestamp of when I believe aliens have been proven. If this predictions turns out to be wrong then this will be my eternal mark of shame and a permanent reminder of my foolish and gullible mind.

VITA EST
