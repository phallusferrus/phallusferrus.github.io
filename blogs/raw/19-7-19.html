The rumors are telling me that new years at the Chase center seems out of the question. It will happen, Now what does that mean for me? Well it gives me about 5 months to get ready to fucking party. I dont party as well, or at least as easily, as I once did. Gone are the days of drinking till I puke and passing out on Cameron’s bathroom floor. Gone are the days of getting a ride home from Kyle while we’re all shit-faced off the tequiler and I just finished dropping my guitar for what, the 4th time for the night. Speaking of which damn if I dont hella miss plying guitar. Sometimes I tstart thiking about how uch un it was and it makes me sad to know that it’s all over. Its all over isnt it? I suppose It doesn need to be but the ythumb laceration is such a detriment to an occupation devoted to working your hands into strange hapes. Life aint a walk in the park dig it. Its a little bit of a lot of work Women ll want the same thinkg, good dick )or good pussy I undersand some people are homosexual, I was considering myself homosexual for a time but I hhave now moved past any such notion, that shit just hurts too much. Anyway back to the subject of New years, ya good chance that bobby, john, mickey., bill, oteil, and  jeff will be in town for the new years and fuck man idk what im gonna do. Today was such a weird day being stoned, and then dropping m bike on my head fuck man that shit really sucked head still gota bup but what ya gonna do, nothing can be done to take it away from the past ony to learn and to grow and to  better prepare myself for the future assuming it will come, like chris says sometimes you justa have to bet on the future being brighter than the presen si becaue if we assume the future is gonna suck...wtf are we even trying for? Well shit jerry fucking kills this scarlett guitar solo like good damn holy fuck idk wht else to say this makes me happy maybe he really is giving  the true compunion of god through his guitar playing...maybe hes just a dude who liked to play the guitar I really dont know pretty sure he was high the whole time and that contantly typing is really taking away from my ability to listne attentively to the music nd now the boys are serving the fire transition and its rteally delicate and mikey is so loud and dfonna sounds so perfect there is definetly a reason this is THE SHOW but there are many others. I was born after he died. This really is not my music, perhaps It is the music that formed me but that still is not me. What does a bird have to do with the dinosaurs other than that the dinosaurs shaped the earth in such a way so as to prepare for the lives of birds. But this is of course unintentional, the dinosaurs had no idea that they would be followed by the flying birds. Just as Jerry had no idea that what he was doing waws in a sense creating me and my reality here 40 years later in San francisco. Its funny really that the human mind is so pliable that it can  be bent to retor such nonesense but yet here we are at 6 48 on the 19yh day of July in the two thousandth and nineteenth year of our lord, anu dominae. Yeahh thats def how you spell that  right I really dont know and to be honest with you correct spelling does not actually matter I guess it is nice to have rules but like phonetic would be better and uhh heres why because there should be stricter rules to spelling but also I have already memorized how to spell eerything so lets not change it but maybe if starting tomorrow all the cool kids at school decide (all the kool kids in skool) to start spelling things a new and better phonetic way I will never personally benefit as my mind is made up on my own way to spell but then they might have a better life in the future. IS that important? Helping the future generations to have a “better” life? Is it even possible to help the future what I wana may not be whats objectibely best now what they want I love the fire on the mountain but what the fuck am I supposed to do to help. It is very clear that something shitty is happeining in the world right now, but it is also clear from the bijs the MEDIA that is that there has always been something shitty going on in the world, if it aint global warming its a damned flood. Think SF has hella homeless people just wait till you hear about Sodam and Gamorah. Yeah this is certainly never goin to ee the light of day, hell maybe I should just toss it now ad get ahead of the curve but I do regret tossing my old notebooks. Firstly they had all my songs and shit on them which I now only have preserved as the soundcloud and youtube vids but also and somewhat more importantly I am missing the semi-~~smokebreak~~compete chronicles of my time living between buttermilk,venice, and finnaly culminating in SF. All I have left is a white notebook I bought at the office depot on Geary at Arguello. Fuck I do love this city but I can already tell I shouldnt be here. First of all I dont give a fuck about money, two I dont give a fuck about rules, and third (and most importantly) I dont give a fuck about other people. The only allure of living in a big city is that you are in close preximity to like a million people… So not particularly liking other people makes living in a city detrimental. LONG DISTANCE RUNNER…

They want my money...thats it. These people are only looking out for themselves and like so am I but the biggest difference is that I will not be screwing other people over in order to benefit myself. For example right now I want to claen m fuck everything is broken give up #quit fuck its so damn hard to be motivational eating oreos and dog food and shit like fucking christ how am I supposed to catch a fucking break im out here loosing my mind in sad francisco all I got is Jerry recordings and 22 years or so of experience. I have no idea whats going on or what to do and theres a FUCKING  FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN I gotta put it out right? Is someone else gonna put it out? Are we just gonna sit here and watch all our shit burn down? Dude I dont know...Im fucking weak what am I gonna do fight the fire? The fire will win, im no match for the Fire. Deafeat right

El ultimo dia que yo trabaje en la ciudad de San Francisco fue un Viernes muy normal. Muy temprano en la manana yo levante, pone me ropa limipie mis dientes y maneje una bicicleta a la edificio donde trabaje. Mi casa fue al lado del parque en el calle de Fulton mas cerca que un mille a la mar y Ocean Beach. Mi trabajo fue al otro lado de la ciudad 

Estimated coming up. Fire Fire, I still dont know how to help.

Perhaps I should schedule up my life? Only do things that will benefit my body. No more sitting for 3+ hours at a computer? IDK but ya I am getting pain and thats gonna fuck my money making abilities. Speaking of that how am I gonna make some good money? I dont need the big bucks. In fact I am sure I’m overthinking this because I dont even want the big bucks. I just want: food, dead music, drugs, dry spot to sleep,oh water bro
