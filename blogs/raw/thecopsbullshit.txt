Walking down the sidewalk he passed and slowed down, then re-approached and stopped in the middle of the street. He rolled down his window and said "Hey you wanna talk for a min / with me" I turned to him holding my brown paper bag up in my right hand and said "Sure" Then looking around as he was stopped in the middle of the road I asked "Do you wanna go somewhere or what?" He shined his light in my face as I grimaced and he said "No, I'm just looking for someone and obviously you're not him." I stared back blankly and said "OK" when he asked "What's your name?" I replied, somewhat disturbed, "Why do you need to know my name? What is this a Terry stop or something?" He said "No, you wanna be like that?" to which I replied "Am I being detained?" He made me say it twice. My voice was trembling. After I repeated myself he replied "No" I turned and walked away before he was finished "You're free to go any time you like. You prick!" He cursed at me and drove past me down the road. I halfway expected him to come back and torture me, there's really no law out here. Or I suppose he was the law out here. I have never had a less professional encounter with a police officer before.
