Jesus fuck:
<br><br><br>
	Shit on the shingle, Christ on the pringle
<br><br><br>
It's been two months since I typed one of these? What the fuck have
<br><br><br>
I been doing. Shit really is starting to worry me that's 60 days 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
(1/20***
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
*Yes...I am this stoned. DUDE THIS HAS TO STOP! GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER*
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
1/6 ***of
<br><br><br>
the year) That I just did nothing for. Pride was fun but since then it's 
<br><br><br>
just been pinche chamba and getting stoned doing nothing with Chris. OK I
<br><br><br>
was wrong just found a writing from 7/19 NOT QUITE a month ago... Also that
<br><br><br>
was the last time I did a LICK of webdevelopment. I don't think I enjoy doing
<br><br><br>
that but I also sure as fuck don't love la chamba and I do that every day. 
<br><br><br>
Honestly it isn't so bad the only problem is I just don't know how to get along 
<br><br><br>
with other people. I always end up being weird, or mean. I think the main
<br><br><br>
allure of computer work is being able to stay away from everyone else and just
<br><br><br>
shut myself up all alone. Also the money is rather alluring as well. So ya
<br><br><br>
I guess the only way I'll ever drag myself up out of this pit of despair is
<br><br><br>
to make a whole lotta money and be all about that. Fuck. Well two options:
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
			I. CODE		II. DIE
<br><br><br>
			II. DIE
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
			WHADDYA THINK?
