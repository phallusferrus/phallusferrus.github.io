</table><br><br><br><br>Mael:	What happy welcome is this, for your Earl
<br><br><br>
	to find his royal cousins kill their lord,
<br><br><br>
	my father's death become my coronation
<br><br><br>
	whose blood now stains the city of our birth,
<br><br><br>
	to be greeted by your sullen faces?
<br><br><br>
	What have you Donnchad or wicked Domnall
<br><br><br>
	an answer? Or a prayer? Please do rebut.
<br><br><br>
	The law which you have broken is quite clear.
<br><br><br>
	A murderer is unforgivable?
<br><br><br>
	Speak up! A little louder I cant hear
<br><br><br>
	your voice has little power, less than your heart
<br><br><br>
	less than your courage! Alone I stand and
<br><br><br>
	speak to many, you to one. To kill is
<br><br><br>
	not permitted in this land. My father too
<br><br><br>
	was guilty, evil, unworthy and mad.
<br><br><br>
	Murder is a sin, the 6th commandment.
<br><br><br>
	But under God a right is not two wrongs.
<br><br><br>
	And under God the hierarchy is
<br><br><br>
	kings and earls from heaven are your leaders
<br><br><br>
	and you are not the ones who may decide
<br><br><br>
	who is king nor who is doomed to die. God
<br><br><br>
	alone has this power. Reparation
<br><br><br>
	for your mortal sins is life in prison
<br><br><br>
	Who should think them innocent and pay not
<br><br><br>
	for their heinous crime? If any one of
<br><br><br>
	you should wish our places were reversed
<br><br><br>
	let your cries be heard, and deplorably
<br><br><br>
	this pathetic cry may sneeze and take my place.
<br><br><br>
	None at all who would prefer this devil
<br><br><br>
	in my fathers house? Then justice is done.
<br><br><br>
	People to your duty! Just one devil
<br><br><br>
	is among our midst? Has Domnall fled the
<br><br><br>
	city in fear of what he must pay? Well
<br><br><br>
	Domnall will be found and soon will join you,
<br><br><br>
	until then it is solitary for
<br><br><br>
	this Donnchad the wicked, Donnchad the weak,
<br><br><br>
	Donnchad the devil. Now fair people know
<br><br><br>
	I come Conchobar's son not only to 
<br><br><br>
	avenge his death but also to repent
<br><br><br>
	Kings and rulers are given charge to care
<br><br><br>
	for their people as champion and friend.
<br><br><br>
	My father in these stations surely failed 
<br><br><br>
	but I am ready to make up for this.
<br><br><br>
	I share a part in all your grievance too:
<br><br><br>
	I as well felt fear when the tyrant took
<br><br><br>
	from my only brother first his titles
<br><br><br>
	then his life. I as well suffered on the
<br><br><br>
	fields protecting our farms and families
<br><br><br>
	from the men of Dublin. An invasion
<br><br><br>
	caused by the ill temper of a tyrant.
<br><br><br>
	Who could not feel disgust when Conchobar
<br><br><br>
	threw his newborn son to his death? He is
<br><br><br>
	forever a stain on my family,
<br><br><br>
	and a disgrace to the city herself.
<br><br><br>
	Now fair people we must make our amends
<br><br><br>
	if we are to carry on and bear the
<br><br><br>
	burden left by my father's nastiness
<br><br><br>
	we must work together, trust each other
<br><br><br>
	and (to the best of our abilities)
<br><br><br>
	put behind the past to help the future.
<br><br><br>
	I will at once proceed inside the hall,
<br><br><br>
	where Dinertach will swear me in as earl,
<br><br><br>
	and then commence a glorious feast. 
<br><br><br>
	For fifty seven days into the night,
<br><br><br>
	one day for every year upon his head,
<br><br><br>
	we all will come at length to trust our friends
<br><br><br>
	And in this way your trust will sure be won.
<br><br><br>
	Come inside! All! Bishop to your duty!
<br><br><br>
	
<br><br><br>
	
<br><br><br>
