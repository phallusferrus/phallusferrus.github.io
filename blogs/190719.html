</table><br><br><br><br>The rumors are telling me that new years at the Chase center seems out of the question. It will happen, Now what does that mean for me? Well it gives me about 5 months to get ready to fucking party. I don't party as well, or at least as easily, as I once did. Gone are the days of drinking till I puke and passing out on Cameron’s bathroom floor. Gone are the days of getting a ride home from Kyle while we’re all shit-faced off the tequiler and I just finished dropping my guitar for what, the 4th time for the night. Speaking of which damn if I don't hella miss playing guitar. Sometimes I start thinking about how much fun it was and it makes me sad to know that it’s all over. Its all over isn't it? I suppose it doesn't need to be but the thumb laceration is such a detriment to an occupation devoted to working your hands into strange shapes. Life ain't a walk in the park dig it. Its a little bit of a lot of work Women all want the same thing, good dick (or good pussy, I understand some people are homosexual. I was considering myself homosexual for a time but I have now moved past any such notion, that shit just hurts too much.) Anyway back to the subject of New years, ya good chance that bobby, john, mickey, bill, oteil, and  jeff will be in town for the new years and fuck man idk what i'm gonna do. Today was such a weird day being stoned, and then dropping a bike on my head fuck man that shit really sucked head still gotta bump but whatta ya gonna do, nothing can be done to take it away from the past only to learn and to grow and to  better prepare myself for the future assuming it will come, like Chris says sometimes you just have to bet on the future being brighter than the present because if we assume the future is gonna suck...wtf are we even trying for? Well shit jerry fucking kills this scarlet guitar solo like good damn holy fuck idk what else to say this makes me happy maybe he really is giving  the true communion of god through his guitar playing...maybe hes just a dude who liked to play the guitar I really don't know pretty sure he was high the whole time and that constantly typing is really taking away from my ability to listen attentively to the music and now the boys are serving the fire transition and its really delicate and mikey is so loud and donna sounds so perfect there is definitely a reason this is THE SHOW but there are many others. I was born after he died. This really is not my music, perhaps It is the music that formed me but that still is not me. What does a bird have to do with the dinosaurs other than that the dinosaurs shaped the earth in such a way so as to prepare for the lives of birds. But this is of course unintentional, the dinosaurs had no idea that they would be followed by the flying birds. Just as Jerry had no idea that what he was doing was in a sense creating me and my reality here 40 years later in San Francisco. Its funny really that the human mind is so pliable that it can be bent to retort such nonsense but yet here we are at 6 48 on the 19th day of July in the two thousandth and nineteenth year of our lord, anu dominae. Yeahh that's def how you spell that right I really don't know and to be honest with you correct spelling does not actually matter I guess it is nice to have rules but like phonetic would be better and uhh here's why because there should be stricter rules to spelling but also I have already memorized how to spell everything so lets not change it but maybe if starting tomorrow all the cool kids at school decide (all the kool kids in skool) to start spelling things a new and better phonetic way I will never personally benefit as my mind is made up on my own way to spell but then they might have a better life in the future. IS that important? Helping the future generations to have a “better” life? Is it even possible to help the future what I want may not be whats objectively best nor what they want. I love the fire on the mountain but what the fuck am I supposed to do to help. It is very clear that something shitty is happening in the world right now, but it is also clear from the bijs the MEDIA that is that there has always been something shitty going on in the world, if it ain't global warming its a damned flood. Think SF has hella homeless people just wait till you hear about Sodam and Gamorah. Yeah this is certainly never goin to see the light of day, hell maybe I should just toss it now and get ahead of the curve but I do regret tossing my old notebooks. Firstly they had all my songs and shit on them which I now only have preserved as the soundcloud and youtube vids but also and somewhat more importantly I am missing the semi-~~smokebreak~~compete chronicles of my time living between buttermilk,venice, and finally culminating in SF. All I have left is a white notebook I bought at the office depot on Geary at Arguello. Fuck I do love this city but I can already tell I shouldn't be here. First of all I don't give a fuck about money, two I don't give a fuck about rules, and third (and most importantly) I don't give a fuck about other people. The only allure of living in a big city is that you are in close proximity to like a million people… So not particularly liking other people makes living in a city detrimental. LONG DISTANCE RUNNER…

They want my money...thats it. These people are only looking out for themselves and like so am I but the biggest difference is that I will not be screwing other people over in order to benefit myself. For example right now I want to claen m fuck everything is broken give up #quit fuck its so damn hard to be motivational eating oreos and dog food and shit like fucking christ how am I supposed to catch a fucking break im out here loosing my mind in sad francisco all I got is Jerry recordings and 22 years or so of experience. I have no idea whats going on or what to do and theres a FUCKING  FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN I gotta put it out right? Is someone else gonna put it out? Are we just gonna sit here and watch all our shit burn down? Dude I dont know...Im fucking weak what am I gonna do fight the fire? The fire will win, im no match for the Fire. Deafeat right

El ultimo dia que yo trabaje en la ciudad de San Francisco fue un Viernes muy normal. Muy temprano en la manana yo levante, pone me ropa limipie mis dientes y maneje una bicicleta a la edificio donde trabaje. Mi casa fue al lado del parque en el calle de Fulton mas cerca que un mille a la mar y Ocean Beach. Mi trabajo fue al otro lado de la ciudad 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Estimated coming up. Fire Fire, I still don't know how to help.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Perhaps I should schedule up my life? Only do things that will benefit my body. No more sitting for 3+ hours at a computer? IDK but ya I am getting pain and that's gonna fuck my money making abilities. Speaking of that how am I gonna make some good money? I don't need the big bucks. In fact I am sure I’m overthinking this because I don't even want the big bucks. I just want: food, dead music, drugs, dry spot to sleep,oh water bro
