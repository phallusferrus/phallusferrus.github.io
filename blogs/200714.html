	So much has happened in the last few days, it's felt more eventful than the last few weeks. I have successfully returned from Vancouver after making critical trips to the bank and the dispensary. I returned with a half ounce and my goodly thousands. Since I wore a mask no one said anything and it was even pretty similar to what it was like back in Febuary.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	When I went into the bank a few odd things happened. Firstly the door was locked but a nice man unlocked it for me and directed me to a woman at the counter. I told her my withdraw needs and handed her my information. I never took the mask off the entire time and after walking out with the cash in my bag I felt like I had robbed the place. Of course my account information has been updated to record the transaction but the novelty of casually walking into a bank wearing a mask was enjoyable to say the least.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	I called Casey last night while walking back to the spot after eating Subway down by the river. He's still in SF, still working at the Market Street Whole Foods and he didn't offer to let me stay with him. I didn't ask either but the vibes were pretty strange. I should have stayed in contact with him. His attitude when he picked up makes me thing I shouldn't even go back to the city but if I do he would probably be down to chill. It's always nice to have a friend, as a matter of fact I believe I have seen it written that friends are worth more than fortunes and occasionally I agree.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	I'm having a budweiser and smoking as much weed as I want. I got a half ounce of the smalls and it cost me $100! It was indoor and he told me they were all out of outdoor. The weed industry has clearly been effected by the pandemic, though the food industry seemed much the same. I went into Safeway after picking up the weed, the shelves were well stocked. I got a couple soup cans and an emergency triple shot of caffeine.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	My alarm went off this morning at 8 am, about an hour and a half after I closed my eyes. I lounged about, texted my ride, and got dressed. I hoped out the window into the already heating morning and met Jared, my ride, at about 9:06. He was very nice, probably the ideal ride. He didn't ask any questions, he wasn't on any visible drugs, he drove fine, and his car was very clean. I suspect he's living in it but IDK it was very clean. I had him drop me off at the Safeway and he drove around aimlessly (past me twice!) while I did my business then he picked me up on call and left me back on the road in front of the trailer park. Just ideal, he offered more rides if I want them. Ideal.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	Unfortunately I have learned that in the state of Washington you must receive new plates when purchasing a used car. That will prevent me from getting a car up here...and same rule in Oregon. So, if I am to go back into a vehicle and purchase my freedom I will have to travel to California first and then get a car. That makes the whole thing a bit more complicated as I would arrive in San Francisco in the afternoon and have only that day to find and buy a suitable vehicle. I could look at maybe 2 (3 would be near impossible) cars before the sun went down and if they were both clunks I'd be on the streets.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	If only Casey and I were on better terms. He told me he's still on Broadway. We texted today about Central Subway, perhaps if I just text him here and there for a few days / weeks he'll come around an offer me a spot. I don't really want to ask, and the worst part is it really would literally probably be just a day or two. So many times someone says that though and it does not materialize and I can understand him wanting to keep his private space after what happened with Chris. Or also maybe he's already got someone else living there now. I dont know but maybe I'll find out.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	Where does that leave me now then? Well, the greyhound pulls out of Portland every evening around 6 PM (1800) and costs between 1 and 2 hundred dollars. Upon arriving in SF I could buy a tent, try for a car, or go beg Casey. If I end up in a tent I could go to the Presidio and try for a car again (though IDK where I would store the tent) If I went for the car I risk spending the night without a tent which could lead me down a slippery slope to selling Crack in the Tenderloin. IDK. IF I were to get the car that would be nearly ideal. I could be absolutely free, get IN N OUT for dinner and even if I couldn't get the blankets or pillow or the seat down or whatever just sitting in the car would be WAAAY better than sitting outside. If I went to beg Casey he could tell me to kick rocks and I would have only lost time OR he could give me a spot close to the bank so that I could go out and look for cars without the fear of winding up on the streets if the car doest work out. That would also be ideal, and sounds like the safest option.

	There was a comet in the sky this evening, dim, directly over Kelso. I also saw a shooting star and a possible meteor. The 'meteor' was far brighter than a normal shooting star and burned a path over the train tracks while I was walking past the coffee drive in and the tree I stayed dry under. Cosmic happenings in the sky, and the crescent moon is this weekend. Ain't I supposed to be 'somewhere in San Francisco on a back porch in July just lookin up at heaven and that crescent in the sky' the words do not lie, Hunter was precise about where I should be.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I typed out my updated resume using LaTeX, it's saved on my github in the works directory. It's too long, three pages, but I would rather have it too long and complete than missing something. Hopefully I will be able to edit it before sending it out if a job hunt ever materializes for me. I would really dig some employment right about now, I'm pretty bored tbh...

Beer, buds, hot pockets, donuts, pretzels, and when I'm lucky: SUBWAY
