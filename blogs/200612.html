<br><br><br>
My time is quickly coming to an end.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	I left last night at midnight and walked into town. I had tried to stay optimistic and believe google maps that the Chevron would be open till 1 AM. It was not. It took me around a half hour to walk down there, a policeman shined his light on my from across the street, and the windows of the gas station were dark.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	My stomach growled while I realized that I would not be able to get any more food. I turned around, that's when my feet started to hurt. I had hoped to have recovered from the last time, and I had, but after walking only 2 and a half miles my right foot became injured again. It still hurts now over 24 hours later. I have around ten cans and 30 pounds of rice left. I am already counting down my days. I can't walk two miles and I'm 15 miles south of a bus stop. Even if I walk downtown to hitchike I wont be able to walk at all after. I could in theory get a ride to the Greyhound but then I wont be able to walk in whatever city I end up in.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	I'm running out of time and still don't have a single solid plan. I painted myself into a corner and now I need to get out, but it just takes one mistake to fuck everything up.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 I had chicken and rice, again, today for dinner. I only get about one meal a day and now that I've run out of oatmeal, ramen, and peanut butter, it's the only food I get. I'd like to add a second round of rice but there's barely any time in the day. Therefore I proposed a sleeping schedule change. The good hours are roughly 11-6 so I should wake up by like 9 o' clock that means going to bed between 10 and 12. That's usually the toughest time for me to go to sleep but I'll have to figure it out. I've been only taking naps since Wednesday. I was up for over 24 hours when I went for that walk and since then I've had two 3 hour naps. I'm hoping I'll be tired later this morning and sleep through the afternoon.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
The writing's going well, but my hands are starting to hurt again. Guess I'll have to take another break, and with the condition my life is in at this point, it might be the last break I ever get. Sometimes death sounds almost like a release.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
If I could get to Kelso I'd have to ride the bus, in Portland I could go and buy a car as long as the banks were open or the seller accepted check. Even if I bought one I'd still have goodly thousands and a place to sleep and keep my stuff. Otherwise I'll be left on the streets, I've never rented a spot on the day of, well maybe a hotel room, airbnb, or by some miracle go stay with friends. There are jobs coming back but I wonder how long they'll last. It feels like the system is starting to collapse, and this will have extreme global repercussions. If anywhere is safe, it's not the cities, it would be better for me out in Willow Creek than anywhere down there. Too much could change, and there's no where to run in a city. On the other hand, San Francisco is beloved by the rich, or was. Really where do their loyalties stand? With their towers, or with newer forms of wealth? Perhaps we have witnessed an evolution, the abandonment of human urban life in favor of more diluted behavior. I was beyond convinced that city life was for the benefit of the planet but people only care about themselves and they'd prefer a barn out by a lake.
