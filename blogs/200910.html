<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I've really just woken up, the sky is an amber grey color and the smoke is so thick I can not see past the first ridge opposite my bed across the Columbia River. There have not been clear skies in 3 days now. The sunrise and sunset are crimson and despite my best efforts to keep my room shut the poisonous smoke still seeps in. Waking feels like I'm still in a dream and my lungs still make sounds though I have not smoked yet. Maybe a quick bong hit will help. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
OK, so I had a little more than just one. The time is 1919 and I took maybe 3 or 4 hits, snuck into the restroom, checked the status of the wildfires, and watched the new Mental Outlaw video on Youtube. I am in a much different state of mind than I was an hour ago and I'm tempted to begin a new post but I've decided to simply soldier on as I have been putting this update off for far too long and too much has happened which needs to be discussed for me to keep throwing away any progress I've made. The sun is just now setting after an entire day of bleak dusk.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
How far back must I go? I'll start with today, then go back three weeks. The reason for my writing is, or at least was, a powerful dream. I think the smoke (and therefore my struggle to breathe properly) must be having an effect on my dreams or perhaps it's a matter of metaphysics and the ancients were correct in their beliefs that dreams are true messages from another world or higher power. All I am sure of is while I slept I spoke with Noelle. For someone who once meant so much to me I think of her little and speak of her less, but there she was. Wearing a purple rainbow dress which parted at her navel and adorned by a matching belt and shoulder straps we laid together in bed as I made fun of the tag on her clothes. Her skin was soft and everything felt very real. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I woke up in a cold sweat scared and confused by these visions. I tried to reconcile WHY I was having this dream. Surely I thought for two years now I had moved completely past her. Since my arrival in San Francisco I had been occupied with other matters and being so far removed from her I was confident I'd put her behind. In fact since my time on the road I was more preoccupied with survival and random girls to ever give much though to Noelle. The last time I saw her she was round and yellow at the Arcata Plaza farmer's market with Medusa McKenzie (which is a strange name by the way, McKenzie is. I had to google (DDG!) the spelling and it still seems off) I saw her mount a classic bicycle across from Don's and ride away to the west. The next day Tinuviel came to Buttermilk and I left forever.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
That's not to say I forgot her, I "won't forget her" Sir Paul promises, but for years after our relationship I could barely think of anything other than her. The last two years have been a refreshing return to normal but of course she still lingers in my thoughts. I realized today, in my scramble for an explanation in regards to the dream, that today in September 10th, the one after 909, 5 years to the day since The Sun Fell Out of the Sky. She asked me to be with her and that dude. The forest, the yoga pants, the awkward boner while sitting on her ass. The J with Oscar, his funny blue shirt, Blondies, the blue cigarettes. The kiss on the cheek, the sun fell out of the sky. The tears and the truck. Kimberly and the root beer.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I knew then, before really, but I could not be fooled by then that she would hurt me. I got out and immediately life brought me together with Kim and I told her to fuck off... I saw Primus, Noelle and I drifted back together, and the rest is now history. So 5 years after I knew she was no good I lay with her in a dream and enjoy an illusory re-imagination of the days (or nights rather) of my life. What is that? A coincidence? Or are perhaps dreams truly the stuff of magic and higher powers? Logos tells me coicidence, and Pathos tells me it's divine. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I'm sure she'll come back up before these writings cease (well I hope these writings go on long enough for her to come back up) but on the off chance that I perish in flame along with these wildfires but by some divine miracle she comes to read these later I might as well leave a short message to her.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Noelle,
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
	Five years ago today I knew the truth,
<br><br><br>
the very nature, of your intense love.
<br><br><br>
It is as bountiful as all the seas
<br><br><br>
but powerful, impossible to tame,
<br><br><br>
like trying to enslave with chains the tide,
<br><br><br>
and I was badly bent beneath the weight.
<br><br><br>
I'm sorry for the things that I have done
<br><br><br>
but really there is nothing I regret.
<br><br><br>
I only say these things to take you back
<br><br><br>
because my heart is evil, lusty, black.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
That's like not even what I meant to say but I followed the meter and the rhythm and that came out. It's all true too. That's Bob Dylan's secret to songwriting you know, "Just tell the truth." I wish you and I had never met, because to know how sweet life and love can be only makes the fouler of my life as it is today. No love, barely life. You set too high a bar for me to clear. Before you I thought myself a worthless scum, somehow you made me almost love myself, and now I'm back, lower than I was at first. Each day more tortured by the lengthening years... I found your Instagram and I screen-shotted the pics. You know I'm only human, can you blame me for wanting to be with you? I don't want to live like this, and I understand that you must follow your own path but I will not lie, my greatest desire in this world is you. In the most selfish way I want you. I don't want to help you, I want you as mine. This is frowned upon by our society, perhaps society is right. I only know that deep down truly the only thing I care about having is you...and I had you, Wednesday evening, all to myself. It's not fair to you and I don't care. That's who I am. Were I the Dictator of Everything you would be brought to me immediately. You gave me an opportunity to re-connect and I spat in your face. It hurts me too much. The eternal sting from your cold indifference has done more injury to me than all others combined. The girl I knew is gone, changed, faded away. There is a new girl in her place. The world keeps spinning today 5 years, tomorrow 50, and never again will I have you, oh well.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 Cruel and tormentous time. Memory the masochist. Reality...
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
These thoughts do me no good, it was wise of me to shut them up. For many years I have not felt these sharp and sad stings as I do now. They pulse through me filling my gut with disgust, my throat with a lump, my tongue with a rough dryness, my eyes with a heavy tear and my head with an immense pressure. I'm cold, sad, and alone. 
<br><br><br>

OK, that took me 45 mins listening to Miles Davis to put down and I haven't even gotten to the real subject of my post which is my life over the last few weeks. Let me take a moment (and another bong hit) and I will begin with the tale.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
After 3 or 4 runs through Star Wars I started to get bored of the films. I still like New Hope, and can usually make it through Empire but I only sat through Jedi once. It's really hard for me to get through the Yoda>Ewoks section but Jabba's Palace is badass so I can watch that 30-45 mins whenever I want really. But yeah I wanted to play Minecraft but without a controller or mouse that was out of the question. I LOST a game of CK2 (Wales, Glywysing) and that was a bit disheartening and I was really just rotting away on 4chan when a pepe sparked my interest in something forgotten, Lord of the Rings. It's the Gandalf Pepe and it made me want to watch all the movies. I was running low on weed and saved up enough saying "I'm just gonna go out in a blaze of glory getting stupid stoned watching all the extended editions" but one big problem I don't have ANY of the movies. Luckily for me after a short amount of googling I found a website that hosts many if not most movies for download <a href="https://gdrivedl.com">gdrivedl.com</a> This is NOT a torrent site mind you these are direct downloads from people's google drives. I was sceptical at first but after chatting in their discord briefly I decided to download the movies. 30 gigs but I have them now all in HD 7.1 surround sound blu-ray rip. The sound was mixed wrong at first but this is fixed by specifying the number of audio channels in MPV.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I sat and watched all three extended edition movies back to back to back. It took over 12 hours. I smoked every single time someone on screen smoked also a few other times. They're really really well made films but I feel like they need to be watched back to back to back and it's such an investment of time it can be hard to make it worth it. Marijuana really enhances the experience as well. All in all it was a fun way to waste a day. Afterwards I immediately downloaded all the books and I've been puttering about in the Silmarillion again. Tolkien truly created an amazing and ledgendary world.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
One other thing the movies made me feel was an extreme urge to play Minecraft. As soon as I finished The Return of the King I went onto Craigslist in search of a PS4 controller and was pleased to find a new listing. He wanted $35 for a 'lightly used' black controller. I offered him $100 if he'd deliver. He agreed and I met him the next day down at the Chevron. Over the phone he sounded like a kid who needed his mom to drive him up here, in person he was fat neckbeard wearing a Nirvana shirt. I handed him the bill he handed me the controller and I was on my way. I noticed the busses were starting back up again and I felt that it had been a perfect day. "Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen" I would mutter to myself. Arriving back home I found the controller he sold me was broken. He scoobed me. If it cost me $100 to ride the bus again I was willing to make that sacrifice. I was disappointed but immediately began plans to go into town. The first day was Tuesday, Sep. 1st.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Last Tuesday I slept only 3 hours. I was up by 9 and walked down to the bus stop on Elm street. I listened to Coltrane as the people drove by. The bus arrived and I got on wearing my mask and holding two dollar bills. The driver told me no need to pay and that the bus would be free all week. I sat in the back center seat and made small talk with him. "Horrible smell huh?" "I can't smell anything" A woman working for the city came by to pick up a bus schedule and we drove north to Longview. On google maps I was expecting Longview to be hell and it almost was. I walked over to Target as the day began to heat up and I saw zero places to sit down. Target was refreshingly normal I found gallons of hand sanitizer, PS4 controllers, USB sticks, and a hot redhead 'mousey' looking girl working in the electronics department. She rang me up, I broke a $100 and walked right out the door. Next I loaded my backpack up and went across the street to Safeway where I got a pound of General Tsao's chicken only because it looked so damn fresh. Easily the freshest I have ever seen Safeway chicken. I saw the manager was a short asian man wearing a blue shirt and tie. He runs a great department, it seems to me a waste that he should be in this random Safeway in Kelso but maybe it's an important grocery store for the area. It was massive and I was impressed. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Next I went to Main Street Marijuana. The walk there was hot and crossing the bridge I nearly got ran over by a skinhead on a tweaker bike but I crossed into Longview and made my way onto the main street. Many people looked at me from out of their cars, I noticed the girls looking at me. There were beautiful women everywhere it seemed. Perhaps months of isolation have simply made me desperate for female attention but I must have made eye contact with at least half a dozen hotties. One blonde girl even SMILED as she waved me across an intersection. Is this that small town friendly vibe...or am I imagining things...or were the people HAPPY with me? Strange times. I went into the weed shop where they made me take off the mask I had just tied on to verify my ID then sold me an ounce and a bong. The entire experience was pretty much ideal. I picked up the paper but could never find anything (they have too many pages! It may be purposefully confusing) but very quickly the guy with long hair and painted fingernails asked if he could help me find something. I told him I just wanted the cheap ounce preferably indica. He said they had no ounces of indica and I told him I didn't really care. He pointed out some $70 outdoor (roughly trimmed!) ounces but said he had some in the back that were $110. He pulled one out for me and I saw it was Blue Dream and looked fine. I said I'll take it. He went to put my order in and I browsed the shop. There was a perfect little blue beaker base bong for $30 and I had the man wrap it up in bubble wrap before I stuffed it into my backpack. The guys were joking around with me and we all seemed to be having a good time. I made eye contact with the girl in the back. As I walked outside I thought I head them say 'that guy was cool' but I could be imaging that.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
At this point I still had a few hours until the bus came back so I made my way to WinCo to check out the inventory and look for a phone charger. I was surprised to find all the shelves were stocked the produce was filled and a wonderful 10 ft braided cord for my phone cost less than $10. I went around the block and thought about going into Jimmy Johns or Domino's but I really wasn't hungry after the chicken so I just headed back towards the bus stop. I was thirsty though so I went to another Safeway in Longview and got a Kombucha. There were a lot of tweakers hanging out at this Safeway and the vibes sort of reminded me of the Market Street location. I made my way onto a side street near the Bus stop and sat on a rickety bench while drinking my Kombucha and admiring the beautiful women then I waited some more at the bus stop. It was quiet and I got a little bus stop overhang bench to myself. I noticed a blonde dready girl sitting to my right and thought about chatting her up but she had her headphones on and I decided against it. The bus came by and we both got on. The driver gave me a mask and a hand sanitizer for free. The girl stepped on and loudly asked "Kalama?" What are the odds we were both heading to the same place? She had a red bandana hanging limply below her mouth, purple beats, and a large lump underneath her armpit. She offered me some water which I declined and then I tried to make a joke she didn't understand. I think communication is a lot more difficult without facial expressions. The bus was about 4 mins late to Kalama after getting stuck in traffic but we arrived, the driver told me to have a great day, and I walked back to the spot. I was ecstatic and jumped in the window and immediately cleaned my bong, filled her up with water, and took rips while sitting on the floor. Pretty sure I was listening to Voodoo Child but I could be wrong.As I think more about it I'm pretty sure it was actually My Favorite Things by Coltrane.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I spent the last week playing Minecraft. I've barely gotten anything done too it's a very slow game and insanely addictive. My hands did start to hurt and I really should take a break but...we'll see. It's been almost like a full time job I've likely put on over 8 hours each day. It's shocking to turn it on and be unable to tear myself away. Sometimes even just turning my head to take another bong hit is impossible. Hitting shift+tab on Steam and seeing 568 mins played is such a heavy feeling.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I've also installed Arch Linux on a virtual machine and been playing guitar somewhat. So life has been not so bad, but not really a life at all. More just Minecraft and weed and little bits of 4chan and YouTube. The fires started Tuesday I think...or maybe Monday. I remember thinking "This is September...something bad is about to happen" and then looking out the window and finding that something bad was happening. I closed my window and located my N95 masks. I had to make the trip down to the store Tuesday and wore my mask the whole time but it still sucked. Now the smoke is much worse and the forecast shows it getting even worse for the next week... Smoke Season fucking sucks but it sure beats Fire Season. Hopefully where I'm at will stay safe... I've only got snacks for two days. I will have to go back down to the store but in the mean time I might as well take another hit, listen to Voodoo Child again and then go play Minecraft some more.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I stand up next to a mountain and I chop it down with the edge of my hand. I'll take up all the pieces and make an item might even raise a little sand.
