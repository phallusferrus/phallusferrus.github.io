	A day (night) in the Life
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
The date is May 17th, the time is 2:04 in the morning. I am just getting ready for lunch. I have been getting to bed rather late these last few days. Around 10 or 12 each afternoon. The shift in time has it's advantages, as well as it's pitfalls. For example I maximize the useful quiet period of each day (roughly 11-6) but the nocturnal habit (made worse by no way to hang curtains from the windows) has had an adverse effect on my health.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
For several days I could not stop a terrible illness. I had sneezing sickness so bad I bled from my nose, from my lips, and could scarcely watch a video through the extreme distraction of having to constantly attend to a dripping sneezing and chaffing nose. I blame the sleep, partly, more blame lies in the squalid living conditions.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I have just now returned from washing my clothes in the sink. It is the first time I have washed them in nearly a month. The smell may have also played a role in my sickness, as well as the piss bottles. Across directly from where I am sitting is 26 mostly full Gatorade bottles filled with piss. 26 bottles in 24 days. There beside them is my shoddy microwave, and the guitar. A TV I have no way of using is to their left beside my food supply. On the other side of the bottles sits my two trash bags (repurposed raisin bran) my spit bottles, and my tables. The tables are covered in emptied peanut butter jars, empty soup cans, and vitamins. The pipe is there, along with the knife and the pen. The last cup of hand sanitizer is on the further table.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I keep the window open with the fan on 24/7. It helps with the smell.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
My usual routine is to fire up YouTube and split open a ramen. I have enough ramen (one a day) for another week and a half. This morning (at 7 pm) I found a 3 hour Luke Smith livestream. I watched it in one and a half. It was repetative at times, boring at others, and occasionally extremely funny. The smell was bothering me and I had devised a plan to launder my clothes but I had to wait until the house was quiet. I listened to the Grateful Dead live in Seattle  8/29/82 a show they played immediately after the 10 year anniversary Veneta show where I understand Ken Kesey dressed as a referee. The dead played Day Job. It was not 1972 any more.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
While listening I browsed /g/ and worked on Day at School. I am sketching out the Latin portion of the game which is taking me more time than it should. Using JavaScript the game is not as good as it could be in python. Well that's not to knock JavaScript, the problem is simply I don't know how to use the language as well as I should. Or any language for that matter. I am not actually a computer programmer, I don't think I can get through SICP... However I remain committed simply to put something out that people can easily access if they know the URL glasshand.github.io
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Once the coast was clear I made preparations to wash my clothes. I took out the headphones and loaded a video on washing clothes in a sink. I found several which made the process seem easy as pie. So I made haste, and in my haste knocked over a water bottle, and another, and one full of water, and socks, and made a genuine mess where there already was plenty. I cleaned it up, somewhat, and felt like I deserved a bowl. This one must have been the absolute last, I was scraping and scraping and scraping but I barely got a quarter bowl. I smoked it fiendishly and held it in longer than I needed to. I got stoned. I gathered my clothes to be washed and set out with my hand sanitizer and my phone to the bathroom.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I immediately put on 9/30/73 (not being able to find the video the other night has convinced me I ought to put one up myself it's SUCH a good show) and began filling the sink with hot water. Of course there was not drain plug so I made use of a good wad of toilet paper and got to work. The sweatpants were unwieldy. I don't think I got them clean. The underpants were easy though. I used shampoo as detergent and left them up to dry while I took a shit and shower. Tomorrow, hopefully, they will be dry and I will find out if they need to be rinsed again or are ready to wear.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I came back to the room, I forgot my spoon! I decided to leave it, this way I will have a dire motivation to go get it before 6am. I am hungry though so I took out an apple cinnamon oatmeal instant oatmeal pouch and poured a small amount of water into it from a fresh water bottle. I have found that the apple cinnamon flavor tasted the best cold, and they all taste better the less water you use. I am now waiting for the oats to absorb the water and so I sat down to write this brief narrative of my day (Using Alacritty>Ranger>Vim)
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Next I will eat and edit, without a spoon...
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
0242 DONE
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
22:26 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I feel obligated to finish the account of what all I did. I meant to finish this this morning before bed but I got distracted. While sucking the oatmeal out of the pouch I put on 12/19/73 and tried to focus in on the game development again. I am dreading the connect four portion (even though I am confident that I have the fundamental game loop concepts already fleshed out by TTTOE and RPS) and so spent the evening fixing bugs. The workflow for this consists of opening up my game.html in a Firefox window and play testing until something goes wrong. Immediately I found bugs, window displays missing, double clicking, RPS didn't recognize a winner, TTTOE wasn't working at all etc etc.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Fixing the bugs turned out to be much easier than I thought. Most of the time it's a literal typo. Other times I dropped part of the PNG file name. The harder bugs are the ones dealing with the game flow. I will need to re-write many parts of the clickers() function in order to rid the game of the annoying double clicks. Or I can just put in filler screens... IDK yet.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I worked somewhat lazily through the night in this way, occasionally pausing to check /g/ or /mu/ or /wg/ 12/19/73 is a hell of a show the Playin alone is a masterpiece but during the 2nd set jam they get into this crazy insect-noise-jam thing that always makes me take a break and say to myself "What the fuck is that" great show. After the encore (Casey Jones I believe) I went to the restroom, my clothes were still very wet but I cleaned my spoon and made my hasty return, unnoticed. At 6 AM-ish I paused to watch the launch of an Atlas-5 rocket that was livestreaming on YouTube. Space force has a new toy in orbit...wonder what it does. I took the opportunity to crack open a can of Tuna with a side can of Green Beans: Dinner
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
After the launch I switched over to Led Zeppelin live at the Fillmore West April 1969, an amazing recording, and got back to bug hunting. Progress slows around 7-8 AM because I get so tired and also it's very disorienting to be growing drowsy as the sun rises but this is my current life. (I think it goes without saying that I miss the good old days of waking up at 4 am and riding 6 miles across the city but that belongs in another post) I spent maybe 10-20 mins reading the first book of genesis in Latin (with translation help from the KJV on the other side of the screen)
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
By 9 I was getting ready to hit the hay. I brushed my teeth, pissed in a bottle and laid my head down. I have quite a bit of difficulty falling asleep and I stayed on my phone for good long while. First I checked Instagram, Mushroom had a few new videos...he's hangin in there but not having a good time. I researched my pressing question of "Why is XFWM taking up so much CPU" and it seems the consensus is it's caused by my theme changes so I put my computer down for a shutdown. I read for a while about switching window managers but ultimately I think the shutdown should fix the CPU usage issue (it did)
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Finally I pulled the beanie over my eyes and managed to get some shut eye. I don;t recall any dreams.
