I feel like shit!
<br><br><br>
	I really do. Cant quite explain why but every day it seems worse and
<br><br><br>
worse. Like  I cant catch a break. Chris is Fucking Nuts! and it would be in
<br><br><br>
my best interest to stay away from that psycho as much as possible. Sadly,
<br><br><br>
this will mean not chilling with Casey as well. It's gonna be rough on all
<br><br><br>
of us but he might take it the worst. Either way that's life and if they need
<br><br><br>
to rely on someone else to make it, that's their problem. I am confident I 
<br><br><br>
can do it all on my own and not need to hide out with my buddies to survive.
<br><br><br>
The life of a hermit is obtainable AND realistic. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I will need to remember these simple principles:
<br><br><br>
	I. My job is very easy! Just keep it.
<br><br><br>
       II. Just pretend to be happy all the time. People like it.
<br><br><br>
      III. Don't worry about women, it only leads to trouble.
<br><br><br>
       IV. Cannabis is a draw on money, but also keeps me happy.
<br><br><br>
	V. Sleep dummy<br><br><br>
