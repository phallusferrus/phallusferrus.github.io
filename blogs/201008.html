<br><br><br>
4 AM Dark Star is crashing while I'm sitting half naked upright on the edge of the bed. My feet are dangling over the edge and my back hurts, but only a little. I got one of those half jar, triple headed, scented candles at Target, Sandlewood Vanilla flavor. It's annoying but it was a cheap candle. I also got a notebook, a kindle, and some cans of food. That was last week, Friday. I took the afternoon bus down to Vancouver and spent a couple hours sweating and shopping. I also bought some shitty weed that I regret buying. I thought the kindle would help me quit smoking, and it has helped, but I'm still smoking. It's harder to focus on books when you're stoned, probably harder to focus on everything. Makes me wonder how much I've been missing out on this whole time.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
So it's 0420 now! Make a wish! I normally would be compelled to smoke a bowl right now in celebration but I've left the bong in the bathroom and my throat still hurts from smoking so much already! Like I mentioned already this weed is fairly low quality and it's made an obvious difference on my lungs. I think there are rats that have moved in because I am constantly hearing rattling in the kitchen, but at least I've been sleeping better this week. I'm not writing very coherently and I want to blame that on the weed, but I'm sure it's something more serious than that. Despite the flawed nature of these writings I still feel it prudent to complete the exercise for future reference. On that note I have a few important points to touch on  which I will try to do in chronological order.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
The bus to Vancouver was filled with the homeless. One guy was nodded out in the back, a couple with their yappy dog played on Gameboys to my left and I sat alone in the middle pretending to read Cat's Cradle while staring out the window. In town I hit Target first and filled my backpack with toilet paper and silly things I didn't need before the pot shop and Winco. I was sweaty and I did not take the Census mask off until I was back at the bus stop. That's where I had to make small talk with the fat lady from Portland. We talked about theme parks and I lied about my life. I fucked up my lies many times and she never called me out on it. She was sharp in her own way. I mentioned the address of the bus stop in Longview and she remembered it many minutes later while on the phone with her 'girlfriend.' I thought for sure she'd ask me to repeat myself but I was pleasantly surprised in that regard. Our driver was a man who resembled Jason from Q street in a tie dye and no mask. He made fun of the amount of time we wasted fucking with the things. We were joined by a blonde Fox News woman. She and the Fat Portland woman got in a fight about the election. Me and the driver remarcked a number of times but it was too cringe for me to try and get involved beyond 'I remember when masks didn't work and now we got a law about em' and basic shit like that. I got to Kalamaty and thanked the driver before walking home.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I didn't get a chance to buy Subway that day because my backpack was full but I went home and filled my head with books. I learned the weed was shit (found a fucking seed for fucks sake not to mention the bud rot or the fatty stems!) but was pleasantly surprised by how easy to use the Kindle was. The trick is to not connect them to the internet and download books off the internet then upload them using a USB cable from a computer. I read Hamlet, Sartor Resartus, and I am over half way through the Hobbit already in under a week. I also use it to read LLSPI and browse my math textbooks. I'm not sure I'll be able to keep this up (I remember back in May I was in a similarly motivated spirit and March before that) but this fills the gap left by Minecraft, for now.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
On the books there's not much to say about Hamlet. Easily one of the greatest pieces of literature of all time. This was actually my first time reading it all the way through in one sitting and it was so nice to imagine the entire thing play out in my mind's eye. Hamlet's interactions with Ophelia are, ahem, based as fuck, and I noticed for the first time that Claudius is not evil incarnate. Or well, there's more to the back story than meets the eye. Hamlet's father was possibly an ineffective king and especially given the anger of Fortinbras, Claudius may have rightly believed it was for the best to assume the throne himself....But to kill his brother in his sleep..IDK it's a bigger play than I have the brain to discuss. It's larger than I am and I am relieved to be able to admit that. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Sartor Resartus was tougher to get through. It reminded me of an obscure red book I must have found in the library last year (but who's name eludes me still) in that it was dry, had too many annotations, and I felt the author was full of himself. There were several, probably a dozen or so, very introspectively wise lines (All must work or steal) or ideas Carlyle presented but I found that it dragged on in certain places a bit too much. The Blumine story was remarkably on the nose and served to remind me how un-special I am. The christian / anti-utilitarian / anti-republican arguments were unpleasant to me and that surely soured my opinion on the book overall but I tried my best to stay impartial and finish it, which I did. I think it made me a better reader but it was somewhat mentally exhausting, it was not like the Hobbit which I can read half stoned and still digest, I had to be nearly stone cold sober to read Sartor Resartus at a decent rate. 
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I'm going to start my rice in the microwave then I'll be back and discuss the debate.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Okay so today was the Vice Presidential Debate, well yesterday was, but it was only 11 hours ago, and I'm still awake. I watched it live and was pleasantly surprised to hear Robert listening as well in the living room. I believe firmly that anyone who wants to be informed owes it to themselves to watch the primary source itself. Regarding their performance I was expecting Harris to wipe the floor with him. I didn't remember Pence ever seeming charismatic in 2016 and I thought Harris' entire campaign last year was essentially her debate prowess (which I always saw as a scam anyways. There was one democratic debate where I noticed her overtly leaning on rhetorical devices and while proper oration I found it disingenuous which has always been my biggest complaint with the Democratic Party) and her ability to 'take on Donald Trump on the debate stage' or some words similar to those. What I saw was quite the opposite.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
The overall impression I got from the two of them was Pence seemed calm, intelligent, and honestly a better choice for the Republican Party while Harris seemed...bitchy. To her credit I do believe Pence interrupted her first but after the 2nd time hearing her 'excuse me I'm speaking' soundbite coupled with her fake smile I had already made up my mind. I suppose I ought to admit I'm biased against Harris and I've despised her since her run for Senate in 2016. So if anyone else is reading this take that into account, this is a biased review and you should go watch the debate for yourself and come to your own conclusions.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
The most standout moment for me was when Pence cornered Harris over Court Packing (and of course the fly that landed on his head!) That was one of my biggest complaints about the first debate was Joe!'s refusal to answer the question. To be fair Pence essentially dodged the question on abortion and others as well in a typical political way. Coming away from it I had a much better impression of Pence than I had before. He at the very least made a competent argument for fiscal and social conservatism which I hadn't heard put so elegantly in probably 8 years since the Obama/Romney debates. I found this debate to be MUCH more watchable than the first one and I personally believe they should do all of the debates with the candidates sitting down. I think it makes them calm down and not shout over each other as much.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
One more thing I'd like to write down is that watching the media's reaction to these debates, or to Trump's coronavirus, or anything else is so exhausting. They continue 24/7 to push their warped agenda and interpretation of reality and all too many people are not able to see through it. Imagine if for the last 12 years you had access only to their approved media. Imagine all the mind melted millions who watch cable news, browse facebook, use twitter, and know nothing more than what they are told. "Remember everything you know about this you're learning about from us" as they like to say.
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
Well I'm sure this entry doesn't make me look any better to anyone, nor does it make me feel any better. I doubt I made much sense and I wonder if these words will ever be of any use to me or anyone else in the future. Regardless I still feel this exercise worthwhile and at the least it has become a regular activity which I've stuck to performing more or less.
