rpsintro() - display gameboard and ask for move

rpseval() -  display the moves and check if victory gameover and note who won, else 

rps	


tttoe:

Intro / fight?
explain how to play
display board
get move
get billy move
check for win
update board

on draw:
	print board with DRAW

GIMP WORK:
afterfight AND function
tttoeintro ('lets play tttoe')
tttoewin, loose, and draw AND ALL FUNCTIONS


Latin:
Check GBP and aut
Intro (Today's lesson blahblah) - latin1()
What do you know about Rome Anon? - latinintro()
		1 - I saw them on TV! -> Bigfoot in Roma story
		2 - They dressed funny -> Dresses, puked story
		3 - I saw Spartacus -> TV story
Story shot -  1-3story()
reaction - 1-3react()
Roma in Italia est... - romainitalia()
Latin alphabet - latinalpha()
skool6() = Our next lesson will be on math (connect4,romnum)

NEED TO ADD EITHER A PASS AFTER WARNINGS OR DELEGATE THEM TO THEIR OWN TURNS. THE WAY IT IS NOW CLICKING CERTAIN 'OK' ON THE WARNING SCREEN WILL DECIDE YOUR GAME VS SCHOOL DECSIONS (AND LIKELY THIS ERROR GOES BACK TO THE OUTSIDE THING TBH...)


GBPW() - art done


billy2() cant use 2 as indy must be letter
billy2() ART needs doing. intro? Or...nah? - SHOULD be done


rpsjudge drops /das/ in filename - fixed?

YOULOOSE>YOUWIN!
it seems like the rpsloose doesnt pass gameover token. I just had to click once: draw twice: draw thrid:win? I think...idk im sleepy tbh. OK so loose doesnt end the game, neither does Draw but draw does that by design. I want it to loop until someone wins. Loose has a problem. So precicely the problem is it displays "You loose" then "You win" or "You Draw" and then goes from there. I never see the billywins screen. - FIXED was a typo


Double click on rpswin()

Double click on skool(TTO or Latin)
only had to double click to get to TTO. Latin worked no prob

tttoeboarddraw() is missing the .png suffix - Fixed

Selecting but7 on tttoe throws helpers() and then doest go back to ask for row but continues on to col

doubleclick for pokemon and double click to get back to class

doubleclick to return from outside

TTToe does not change batoners from 1s to letters...and it doesnt recognize victory...(win vs winer easy fix)

the flag does now display the options in textbox but batoner works


Double click for house draw and to leave

Tttoe win works now but doesnt display the victory screen before asking for new input...BAD also batoner doesnt changebuttons from a-c still...


*Latin or TTTOE*
#CLICK TTTOE
*FIGHT? OR INTRO*
